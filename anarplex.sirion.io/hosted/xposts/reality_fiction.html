<h2 class="entrytitle">Reality-Fiction Continuum</h2>
			
			<p>It is an interesting question when one takes oneself and tries to fit  into the big picture of things. Becoming clear of one&#8217;s own position in  life, world affairs &#8211; and defining where one wants to be in the future.<br />
When I asked myself these questions I began scribbling down what I  perceived as my personal coordinate system. The result was the name for  this blog, and the picture seen here (it is also the title scribble of  this website):<br />
<span id="more-256"></span></p>
<p><img title="Reality-Fiction Continuum" src="img/minorscribbles-header2.png" alt="" width="532" height="200" /></p>
<p>It represents the continuum between reality and fiction when it comes  to the wakeful perception of our lives and minds. We are all somewhere  between reality and fiction, and we are constantly moving towards or  away from the one or the other.<br />
Instead of simply defining reality as the place I always want to be, I  chose instead to be aware of where on this scale my specific thoughts  are. Reality alone might be an interesting thing, but it is either  static &#8211; or you become a passive object of it. Being aware and embracing  fiction is what helps us shape this reality in the future. And with the  current state of affairs the future seems to look more and more like  our visions of fiction.<br />
So I settled somewhere in the middle, looking both ways, and embracing  fiction as a way to understand and shape the current reality, and the  reality I want to see in the future. To become active in my being. And  to become aware that what we so often claim to know is really just a  mixture of what is and what is imagined, but also that much of what we  want to know and communicate requires to stand separate from a purely  objective way of looking at things. We are simply not capable of real  objectivity &#8211; but we are capable to realize that everything has to be  taken with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>The things near reality that play a major role in my life are Berlin, London, Cyberspace and Violence.<br />
Berlin is the place I mostly operate from, so it is a natural.<br />
London is actually a placeholder for the other cities that have  influenced me and that I still love as hangouts and drop-points: London,  Zurich, Vancouver.<br />
Cyberspace is what my work is most concerned with. This imaginary place  where bits become atoms and travel with the speed of light.  Communication between people on far apart continents, messages that race  around the world and infect our perception. It is where many of our  future conflicts and solutions come from, be it Cyberwar or  Cyberliberty. But it is also one of the biggest distractions ever  invented.<br />
Violence however seems to be a strange pick. It is the negative part of  reality that I am strongly concerned with. Violence, aggression, force &#8211;  these have been parts of human nature and society for a very long time,  and they are amongst the biggest shapers of how we live. But they are  not positive shapers to embrace, but things to control and make less  necessary. I hope and work for being more peaceful, and to work for more  peace.</p>
<p>On the other end of the scale, the place where so many people seem to  be solely captured with their minds, lies fiction. It is where most of  our fears and hopes come from, and what plays a crucial role in our  self-being and choices.<br />
I admit to dream, and do not intend to give it up. Not so much dreams of  escape, but dreams as methods of envisioning solutions, motivating  people and driving business. Dreams is where so much of real innovation  comes from.<br />
But there is more to the side of fiction. It is also where large parts  of media and politics exist &#8211; those tools of make-belief and  self-illusion. Where things are over-simplified and understated.<br />
Last but not least, we have our dear memes. Those little ideas that take  a hold in culture and shape it through the things we long for (dreams),  things we force for (politics), things we lie for (media). I have  always been intrigued by this little concept, without accepting it as a  sufficient way to describe cultural evolution. Still, the concept helps  us think.</p>
<p>My personal impression has been for a long time that many people are  captured within the fiction side of things, without realizing or  admitting it. We usually take pride in being realistic and pragmatic.  But far too often this is an illusion. Instead we should embrace our  ambivalence and enjoy it.</p>
<p>That leaves us with the last elements of the scribble: Art, 5GW, Market and State.<br />
I am interested in art as the exploratory imagination and realization of  perception and hopes &#8211; especially in scifi literature and story-telling  computer games. They both shape future.<br />
5GW stands for &#8220;Fifth Generation Warfare&#8221;. While I am less interested in  this subject today, I was a lot when I made the scribble. It asks the  question of how wars will be fought in the future, who will fight them,  and what strategies will prevail. Well, maybe I am still a bit curious  about it.<br />
Economics and markets versus the State is another major theme in my  thoughts. In spite of good public schooling I came to the realization  that markets are better than their names, and states most often a  hindrance to peace and prosperity. It is one of the battles of this  century &#8211; and deeply interesting and troubling.</p>
<p>Finally, there are things that have not found their way into the  scribble above. Not because they are less interesting for myself, but  because they have little or nothing to do with this blog. These are  things like faith, my wife, my friends, music and vine. While all these  are of varying but great importance to me, they are of little interest  to my struggles between reality and fiction. Those things are settled,  and not public puzzles.</p>
