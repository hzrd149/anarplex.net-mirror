	AN INVITATION

	WHAT: IRC network for liberty builders.
	WHY: The time for waiting for others to do things is over.
	HOW: Using our energy and talents, rather than waiting until some unspecified
	date.

	WHERE: Server: agora.anarplex.net Port: 14716 (SSL Required)
	TOOL: If you don't have an irc client so far, use chatzilla with firefox
	(https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/16)
	This link will connect you: ircs://agora.anarplex.net:14716
	You may want to use an anonymizer to protect your connection.
	However, the IRC server does not know your IP address and cannot make it
	available.

	Mission:
	- - Take risks for liberty. It is up to us to change our lives. Being obedient
	keeps us serfs.
	- - Learn, create, cooperate, advance.
	- - Create reputation and networks of trust.
	- - Talk with people who are not fully brainwashed.
	- - Prove that people can live with each other without coercion.

	Hints:
	- - Use '/msg nickserv help' to find out how to create a persistent identity on
	the network.
	- - Invite others that might want to contribute to liberty.
	- - Respect others. This is a place where only minds meet. Be courteous and
	mature.
	- - Read the posts at http://fau.anarplex.net/

	This is all about creating parallel solutions to establish pockets of tangible
	liberty for you and the people you want to associate with.

	Politics does not work. Loopholes do not work forever. We must build liberty
	as a separate realm.

	Consider our server a country in itself - a place outside of any state. So,
	don't bring the state to it in your mind and do not draw the state?s agents to
	this place.

	The Free and The Unashamed
