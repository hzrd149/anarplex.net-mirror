	= A Declaration of Separation =

	==== To The Governments & People of Earth: ====
	We claim the right to exist, and we will defend it.
	We do not seek to overthrow anything. We do not seek to control anything. We
	merely wish to be left alone.
	All we ever wanted was to live in peace with our friends and neighbors. For a
	long, long time we bore insults to our liberty; we took blows, we did what we
	could to avoid injury and we worked through the system to get the offenses to
	stop. That has now changed.
	We no longer see any benefit in working through the world?s systems. At some
	point, working within a system becomes cowardly and immoral; for us, that
	point has arrived.
	Regardless of the parties in power, their governments have continued to
	restrict, restrain and punish us. We hereby reject them all. We hereby
	withdraw from them all. We hold the ruling states of this world and all that
	appertains to them to be self-serving and opposed to humanity.
	We now withdraw our obedience and reclaim the right to strike back when
	struck. We will not initiate force, but we do reserve the right to answer it.
	We did not choose this ? it was forced upon us.

	==== To The Governments of Earth: ====
	You are building cages for all that is human. In the name of protection, you
	have intruded into all areas of human life, far exceeding the reach of any
	Caesar. You claim ultimate control of our property and our decisions, of our
	travels and even our identities. You claim ownership of humanity far beyond
	the dreams of any Emperor of any previous era.
	Understand clearly: We reject your authority and we reject your legitimacy. We
	do not believe that you have any right to do the things you do. You have
	massive power, but no right to impose it upon us and no legitimacy. We have
	forsaken you. We are no longer your citizens or your subjects.
	Your systems are inherently anti-human, even if all their operators are not.
	We are not merely angry young people. We are fathers and mothers; aunts,
	uncles and grandparents; we are business owners and trusted employees; we are
	mechanics and engineers and farmers. We are nurses and accountants and
	students and executives.
	We are on every continent.
	This is not a burst of outrage; this is a sober declaration that we no longer
	accept unearned suffering as our role in life.
	For long decades we sat quietly, hoping that things would turn around. We took
	no actions; we suffered along with everyone else. But after having our limits
	pushed back again and again, we have given up on your systems.
	If our fellow inhabitants of this planet wish to accept your rule, they are
	free to do so.
	We will not try to stop them. We, however, will no longer accept your
	constraints upon us.
	- - From now on, when you hurt us, we will bite back. If you leave us alone we
	will leave you alone and you can continue to rule your subjects. We are happy
	to live quietly. But if you come after us, there will be consequences.
	You caused this because of your fetish for control and power. The chief men
	and women among you are pathologically driven to control everyone and
	everything that moves upon this planet. You have made yourselves the judge of
	every human activity. No god-king of the ancient world ever had the power that
	your systems do.
	You have created a world where only the neutered are safe and where only
	outlaws are free.

	==== To The People of Earth: ====
	We seek nothing from you. We do not want to rule you and we do not want to
	control you.
	All we wish is to live on earth in peace. As always, we will be helpful
	neighbors and generous acquaintances. We will remain honest business partners
	and trustworthy employees. We will continue to be loving parents and
	respectful children.
	We will not, however, be sacrificial animals. We reject the idea that others
	have a right to our lives and our property. We will not demand anything from
	you, and we will no longer acquiesce to any demands upon us. We have left that
	game. We reject all obligations to any person or organization beyond honesty,
	fair dealing and a respect for human life.
	We will shortly explain what we believe, but we are not demanding that you
	agree with us. All we ask is that you do not try to stop us. Continue to play
	the game if you wish; we will not try to disrupt it. We have merely walked
	away from it.
	We wish you peace.

	==== To Those Who Will Condemn Us: ====
	We will ignore you.
	We welcome and seek the verdict of a just God, before whom we are willing to
	expose our innermost thoughts. Are you similarly willing?
	We would stand openly before all mankind if it were not suicidal. Perhaps some
	day we will have to accept slaughter for our crime of independence, but not
	yet.
	Your criticism and your malice are much deeper than mere disagreements of
	strategy or philosophy. You do not oppose our philosophy, you oppose our
	existence. Our presence in the world means that your precious ideals are
	false. Some of you would rather kill us than face the loss of your ideologies,
	just as those like you have either hated or killed every sufficiently
	independent human.
	You present yourselves to the world as compassionate, tolerant and
	enlightened, but we know that your smooth words are costumes. Oh yes, we know
	you, servant of the state; don?t forget, we were raised with you. We played
	with you in the schoolyard, we sat next to you in the classroom. Some of us
	studied at the same elite universities. We watched as you had your first
	tastes of power. We were the boys and girls standing next to you.
	Some of us were your first victims. We are not fooled by your carefully
	crafted public image.

	==== What We Believe ====
	#1: Many humans resent the responsibilities that are implied by consciousness.
	We accept those responsibilities and we embrace consciousness. Rather than
	letting things happen to us (avoiding consciousness), we accept
	consciousness and choose to act in our own interest.
	We do not seek the refuge of blaming others, neither do we take refuge in
	crowds. We are willing to act on our personal judgment, and we are willing
	to accept the consequences thereof.

	#2: We believe in negative rights for all: That all humans should be free to
	do whatever they wish, as long as they do not intrude upon others; that no
	man has a right to the life, liberty or property of another; that we oppose
	aggression, fraud and coercion.

	#3: We do not believe that our way of life, or any other, will make life
	perfect or trouble-free. We expect crime and disagreements and ugliness, and
	we are prepared to deal with them. We do not seek a strongman to step in and
	solve problems for us.
	We agree to see to them ourselves.

	#4: We believe in free and unhindered commerce. So long as exchanges are
	voluntary and honest, no other party has a right to intervene ? before,
	during or after.

	#5: We believe that all individuals should keep their agreements.

	#6: We believe that honestly obtained property is fully legitimate and
	absolute.

	#7: We believe that some humans are evil and that they must be faced and dealt
	with. We accept the fact that this is a difficult area of life.

	#8: We believe that humans can self-organize effectively. We expect them to
	cooperate. We reject impositions of hierarchy and organization.

	#9: We believe that all humans are to be held as equals in all matters
	regarding justice.

	#10: We believe that the more a man or woman cares about right and wrong, the
	more of a threat he or she is perceived to be by governments.

	#11: We believe that there are only two true classes of human beings: Those
	who wish to exercise power upon others ? either directly or through
	intermediaries ? and those who have no such desires.

	#12: Large organizations and centralization are inherently anti-human. They
	must rely upon rules rather than principles, treating humans within the
	organization as obedient tools.

	==== Our Plans: ====
	We are building our own society. We will supplement traditional tools with
	networking, cryptography, sound money, digital currency and anonymous
	messaging. Our society will not be centrally controlled. It will rely solely
	on voluntary arrangements.
	We welcome others to join us. We are looking for people who are independent
	creators of value, people who act more than talk, and people who do the right
	thing because it is the right thing.
	We will develop our own methods of dealing with injustice, built on the
	principles of negative rights, restitution, integrity and equal justice.
	We do not forbid anyone from having one foot in each realm ? ours and the old
	realm - although we demand that they do no damage to our realm. We are fully
	opposed to any use of our realm to facilitate crime in the old realm, such as
	the hiding of criminal proceeds.
	We expect to be loudly condemned, libeled and slandered by the authorities of
	the old regime. We expect them to defend their power and their image of
	legitimacy with all means available to them. We expect that many gullible and
	servile people will believe these lies, at least at first.
	We will consider traps laid for us to be criminal offenses.
	Any who wish to join us are encouraged to distribute this declaration, to act
	in furtherance of our new society, to voluntarily excel in virtues and to
	communicate and cooperate with other members of the new society.

	Free, unashamed men cannot be ruled.

	We are The Free and The Unashamed.
