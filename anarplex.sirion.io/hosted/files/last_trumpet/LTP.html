	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The northern
	lights were unusually bright tonight, twisting like a sheet of cold
	blue fire above the horizon.  Such displays were uncommon at this
	latitude in British Columbia.   The eerie glare provided little
	practical utility to the men toiling on the steep, snow-covered
	slope, but did seem to some of them like a token of heaven's favor,
	or at least of its acute interest.   It was cold out here in the
	wilderness in these early morning hours of the day after Christmas,
	and hearts as well as bodies were hungry for warmth.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Brother Shawn stood over his
	seismic scanner with his eyes glued to the data screen, which lit
	his anxious face with a glow not unlike the aurora.  His tension was
	understandable.  Just a few yards from him, his compatriots were
	confirming the readiness of an explosive device which they had
	lowered more than a hundred feet into a hole drilled into the dirt
	and loose rock beneath their feet.  The core driller loomed to one
	side, its tractor-like wheels bolstered by braces deployed flat
	against the ground to keep it from tipping, its drill head poised to
	strike again on command, like a giant mechanical woodpecker lodged
	in a snowbank.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Three more such machines, each
	attended by a knot of men, surrounded them at distances of a hundred
	yards or so.  But it was not his laboring brethren or their
	equipment which held Shawn's attention whenever he looked up from
	his monitor to glance at the ridge line above him.   There was no
	mistaking the fact that the crest of the dam was now visibly
	subsiding, and a grey stain of water had begun to appear over the
	lip.  Booming reports echoed back to them off the surrounding
	pine-clad hills as sheets of ice cracked across the face of the
	lake.  Shawn was only too aware of the mass of thousands of tons of
	icy water which hung precariously suspended above them, walled off
	by a barrier which his own scanner confirmed was weakening by the
	moment.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This antique earthen dam had
	proven much more difficult to undermine than they had planned.  Even
	with the scanner, it was difficult to pinpoint reliably its most
	vulnerable structural points.   The charge being readied beside him
	would be their fifth unanticipated <I>coup de grace</I>.  
	Fortunately they had brought plenty of extra explosives.  Despite
	its remoteness, the dam simply could not be left standing with clear
	evidence of sabotage.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">&quot;We're good to go, here,&quot;
	the team's explosives technician confirmed.  The team leader looked
	inquiringly at Brother Shawn.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">&quot;Ready, go ahead,&quot; he
	said steadily.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">&quot;Fire in the hole, then.&quot;
	 Controls were activated.  After only a second's delay, the ground
	lurched beneath their feet, and a rumbling bellow swelled out under
	the night sky.  It was accompanied by a tearing metallic shriek like
	the collapse of something made of steel.  Which seemed odd, because
	there was no steel in the body of this dam.  Shawn studied his
	readouts intently.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">&quot;Well?&quot; came the query
	after a minute.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">&quot;All the weakening was in the
	lower third.  We're gonna need the next one, higher up.&quot;  The
	leader gripped the mic on his jacket with gloved hands and relayed
	instructions to one of the other teams, upslope from them and to
	their left.  Shortly the vibration of another explosion thrummed
	beneath their boots.  The result was immediately apparent, even
	without the aid of the seismic imaging scanner.  The center of the
	vast earthen berm began to droop, and more water began trickling
	over it, darkening the snow.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">&quot;That's it this time, no
	question,&quot; Shawn confirmed.  &quot;It's gone in a matter of
	minutes.&quot;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">&quot;All right, pack 'em up and
	move 'em out.  Come on brothers, let's go!&quot;  Their squad leader
	had no need to motivate his men.  Shawn and a teammate uprooted the
	scanner's sensor arm and bundled the device onto a sled attached
	behind the mobile driller.  The latter was made ready for travel and
	its engine fired up with a roar.  The tense surrounding winter quiet
	disintegrated as the other teams did likewise.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The nervous men jumped onto the
	uphill side of the driller and hung on as it lurched into motion. 
	The tractor wheels churned as it skidded and clawed its way at an
	angle across the slope, making for the top of the dam on the side
	opposite the empty spillway.  Each slew of the wheels made the
	ungainly vehicle forfeit some hard won altitude, almost as if the
	dam were reluctant to permit its destroyers to escape.   The men
	watched above them with trepidation, grudging every heart-pounding
	sideways lurch that lengthened their course.  Shawn kept glancing at
	his chronometer.  Five minutes, six.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">At last the machine crawled up
	onto safe level ground, and the crew leaped off as it shuddered to a
	stop.  From here, looking along the top of the dam lengthwise, one
	could see just how much the center section had subsided.  It was now
	concave enough to permit a steady stream of eager black water to run
	down its outer face.  A distinct bulge was also developing down at
	the base in the center, as water flowed invisibly into the interior
	core of the doomed dam itself.  Shawn knew he should probably hook
	up his scanner again so that he could capture and record the climax
	with hard numbers, but he couldn't tear himself away from the
	spectacle he was witnessing with his own eyes.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The last demolition team, who had
	been farthest down the dam, now reached safety too, and the mood of
	the gathered men began to turn toward celebration.  Cold feet and
	sweaty palms no longer seemed to matter.  They had done it, and the
	rest was now in the hands of God.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Despite their expectations, it was
	nearly another twenty minutes before the center of the old dam
	disintegrated in almost the drawing of a breath.  A wall of water
	and debris blasted out as if a huge invisible fist had punched
	through it at the last moment, and curled like an angry arm over the
	valley below, pummeling the ground.  The roar of the avalanche
	covered the cracking and grinding reports of shattering ice as spray
	soaked the watching men on the cliff, who were now leaping and
	cheering.  Their cries were lost in the rush of destruction, the
	ancient self-vindicating battle howl of crusaders of ages past:</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	it!&quot;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A human hand
	moved a slider control, very carefully, in the manner of one making
	a final delicate adjustment.    Its forefinger tapped on an adjacent
	digital indicator,  expressing both confirmation and satisfaction.  
	Nearby, a three-dimensional holographic display came to life and
	began to show what appeared to be a city street scene, early
	evening, in damp weather.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I think we're ready,&rdquo;
	said a deep voice.  The speaker took his hands off the control
	panel, leaned back in his chair a little bit, and faced the dozen
	other people seated around the lab.  They were of both genders,
	apparently young to middle-aged, all looking at the holo-display
	with solemn interest mingled with excitement.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So that's the street where
	it happened?&rdquo; asked a young red-haired woman in a trim
	business suit.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Will happen.  We're a half
	hour or so early.  Justin, would you confirm the precise
	coordinates, please?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A man with sandy hair and pale
	blue eyes stirred in his chair.  &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he said,
	rummaging in his jacket pocket.  He produced a data stick and handed
	it across the small space between them, both men leaning forward
	slightly in their chairs to facilitate the transaction.  &ldquo;Those
	are the exact time and GPS coordinates from the moment when Craig
	had his accident,&rdquo; Justin confirmed for the benefit of the
	others in the room.  &ldquo;Stefan will now program a tracking
	trajectory for the Cronus Scanner so that we will be able to watch
	the location beginning several minutes before the event.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Right,&rdquo; said Stefan,
	turning back to his controls with the stick, which he inserted into
	a reader with one hand while the other played smoothly over a touch
	pad.  A balding, darkly bearded man of middle age, his deep voice
	effortlessly took on the tones of a seasoned lecturer.  &ldquo;As
	you know, Earth GPS coordinates change continuously as the planet,
	its solar system, and its galaxy hurtle through space.  The Scanner
	adjusts for these positional changes automatically as a function of
	the time interval, so that we see continuous sequential images from
	the correct spatial coordinates in the viewer.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What's the temporal
	scanning resolution?&rdquo; someone asked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Stefan flashed the questioner a
	brief smile over his shoulder.  &ldquo;Microseconds,&rdquo; he
	replied.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">With enough bandwidth to
	support a full quantum brain scan,&rdquo; Justin added.  He and
	Stefan exchanged a smile that was both awed and amused.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	sighed.  &ldquo;That's impressive, but you know where it will lead.&rdquo;
	 For a moment the gathering became even more solemn.  Stefan
	shrugged.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We know.  We've talked
	about it, we've all made plans for it.  The consensus has always
	been that it's a place we have to go.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not doing it would be
	indefensible,&rdquo; Justin said with the air of one repeating a
	sound conclusion validly, however reluctantly, arrived at.  No one
	disagreed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What about the brain upload
	side?&rdquo; another voice asked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin turned in his chair to face
	the rest of the group.  &ldquo;All prepared with the necessary
	resources standing by,&rdquo; he replied.  No one questioned him
	further.  Each of them had, after all, been through it themselves.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I feel like I should make a
	speech of some kind,&rdquo; Stefan said with a wry grin.  &ldquo;But
	I'll leave speeches on the significance of it all to the
	commentators after the fact.  For now, suffice it to say that we are
	peering through the Cronus Scanner back in time to that fateful
	evening in late November, 2038, when Craig Stenson suffered an
	accident which was immediately fatal.  Many of you knew Craig. 
	That's a large part of the reason why he's our first human test
	subject.  We have every confidence, from the Cronus quantscans we've
	done on objects, plants and animals, that this is going to work
	perfectly.  The implications are much greater when it's a human
	being involved, but the operating principles are identical.  The
	viewer is now displaying the scene approximately T-minus five
	minutes prior to the event.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Evidently no one had any further
	questions or comments.  All eyes turned to the holo-viewer, which
	was located more or less in the center of the lab.   Stefan touched
	another control and an auditory system activated, allowing the
	participants to hear as well as see back in time.  The novelty of
	watching an audio-visual stream which was generated in response to
	data being recorded by a passive temporal scanner that was reporting
	on the changing state of everything in its vicinity, right down to
	the states of individual atoms and photons, kept the group silent
	for several minutes.  Some very elegant hyperdimensional mathematics
	was being employed here, along with a prodigious amount of real-time
	computation.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A number of robotic ground cars
	came down the street and disappeared out of the field of view.  Some
	of these contained passengers and some did not.  Just as the time
	display clicked inside of T-minus one minute, another ground car
	came in sight.  The camera perspective was situated under a kind of
	pedestrian overpass, which appeared to be under construction, or
	repair.  As this latest ground car approached, the street began to
	tremble, then to vibrate, and there was a rumbling noise.  The
	partially completed overpass swayed and began to buckle.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As the ground car arrived at the
	scene, the focus zoomed in slightly to reveal a single male
	passenger, and as the overpass began to fall on top of it, the
	picture froze altogether as Stefan touched another control.  There
	was a pregnant pause.  Somewhere in the cyberverse, mighty computing
	engines abandoned their idle loops and turned to the task of
	crunching the data which represented a man, down to the probable
	energy state of the least electron in his body, and transplanting
	that processed information onto a digital computing substrate which
	could likewise run the software of his mind and consciousness &ndash;
	though faster and far more efficiently than his biological brain
	ever had.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Scan successful; we have
	him,&rdquo; Stefan announced.  Excitement held the room in stasis,
	except for Justin who was examining a palmtop display in his lap.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Verifying correctness of
	the instantiation model,&rdquo; he said in a low but cautionary
	tone, like one holding up his hand to forestall an outburst of
	applause.  This took only a minute or so as the computing network
	rechecked its work.  This was a man's life; mistakes could not be
	afforded.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Looks good,&rdquo; Justin
	concluded, looking up.  &ldquo;I'm going to bring him here. 
	Hopefully this will be his only involuntary virtual instantiation
	ever,&rdquo; he said impishly.  Several of the others smiled.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Suddenly a man was sitting in the
	room with them, in one of the chairs that had been empty. 
	Recognizably the same man they had all glimpsed riding in the ground
	car, he looked to be in his middle forties, of average height,
	brown-haired with a bit of distinguished grey at the temples, and a
	slight paunch punctuating an otherwise slim frame.   His expression
	was one of mild disorientation, like someone awakened out of a dream
	or coming back from woolgathering with a start.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Craig?  Are you all right? 
	How do you feel?&rdquo; Justin asked solicitously.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin?  What the&ndash;&rdquo;
	he asked in obvious confusion, then looked around more widely. 
	&ldquo;Stefan?  Kara.  Marina, Ray?&rdquo; he added as he recognized
	several other people in the room.  These murmured greetings or waved
	or nodded in response.  &ldquo;I don't get it, why are you all here?
	 Where am I?  What's going on?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Welcome to the Singularity,
	Craig!&rdquo; said the young woman in business attire, with a warm
	smile.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Huh?&rdquo;  For a moment
	that pronouncement didn't reduce Craig's confusion.  He was focused
	on the peculiar fact that this woman looked younger than he
	remembered her. Then suddenly it all added up for him.  &ldquo;You
	mean I'm &ndash; we're all&ndash;&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It's true, my friend,&rdquo;
	Stefan said reaching over to shake Craig's hand.  &ldquo;The
	Singularity was proclaimed on March 1<SUP>st</SUP>, 2042.  Fully
	non-biological humans.  Total virtual intelligence.  Everything we
	always talked about and worked toward.  We are of course at this
	moment instantiated into a virtual environment where our avatars can
	meet, and which also provides suitable interfaces to enable us to
	control the computing and other resources that brought you here.&rdquo;
	 He gestured at the panels behind him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Right.&rdquo;  Craig knew
	all about full-immersion virtual environments and avatars, since
	those had been ubiquitous by 2030.  &ldquo;So when is it now?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It's October the 27<SUP>th</SUP>,
	2044,&rdquo; Justin answered.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Okay, so why am I missing
	about six years that I don't remember?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Stefan gave him a reassuring grin.
	 &ldquo;Because you never experienced them.  We brought you forward
	in time, as it were.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Time travel?  Why?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm sorry, but we had no
	choice, Craig,&rdquo; Justin said apologetically, and pointed at the
	holo-monitor where the image of Craig in his ground car was still
	frozen.  Stefan zoomed the focus back out some so that the tons of
	debris descending toward the car's roof could be seen.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You remember riding along
	in that car, right?&rdquo; Justin asked, and Craig nodded. 
	&ldquo;Recently, Stefan led a team which perfected a passive
	particle scanner that can be used to scan four dimensional
	coordinates.  It was named Cronus after the ancient Greek god of
	time.  When we realized that the scanner possessed a granularity and
	bandwidth sufficient to support a quantum brain upload, then it
	became possible to do what we just did for you.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Craig got it.  His face blanched
	with shock and his avatar's breath caught.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I don't really need to run
	this image forward a few more seconds, do I?&rdquo; Stefan asked
	gently.  Craig gasped and sat back, looking inward for a moment and
	then finally back at Stefan.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No, that's okay.  Wow. 
	Thanks, everybody.  So I died back in that accident in 2038, is what
	you're telling me.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Actually, no,&rdquo; Justin
	said with a little cautious reluctance.  &ldquo;To be technically
	accurate, you were scanned and uploaded seconds before that
	happened, so you never actually experienced death.  Your human body
	and brain, of course, were damaged beyond repair in the accident,
	including the networked nanocomps which you had in your skull, as
	most people did even at that time &ndash; and still do.  You are now
	a fully non-biological human intelligence, running entirely on
	computational substrates.  Your mind file is completely intact.  But
	because your pattern was uploaded through a fourth dimensional
	scanner, your mind file is missing experiential data for the roughly
	six additional years that it took us to develop this technology.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Craig was nodding slowly now. 
	&ldquo;Right.  So it's not like anything different happened from
	what we planned originally.  I mean we always intended that when we
	could, we'd upgrade ourselves beyond any reliance upon inefficient
	and fragile biological brain circuitry.  But you said the
	Singularity was achieved more than two years ago.  Does that mean
	that there are lots of others like me now?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Stefan spread his hands in a
	yay-nay gesture.  &ldquo;Depends on what you mean by lots.  As soon
	as it became possible to make the final upgrade away from biology,
	some people started doing it.  Justin was the first, followed by
	everyone in this room.  They call us &ldquo;Full Sings&rdquo; today
	because we've crossed all the way across the chasm.  Our awareness
	is no longer situated in any biological body &ndash; although we can
	manufacture and inhabit one in real 3D space any time we wish.  But
	a surprising number of people are still clinging to their original
	biological selves.  Although, just as you did, most of them have so
	much nanocomputing power co-resident in their brains that probably
	99% of their intelligence is running on non-biological hardware
	anyway, just as they spend almost all of their time projecting into
	virtuality.  But it's that last one percent that's the sticking
	point for a lot of humans, especially since their biological
	structures are all renewable now, and therefore, effectively
	immortal in any case.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In fact, uploading the
	nanocomp portion of a human brain is the easy part, since it's
	essentially a straight upgrade,&rdquo; Justin mused.  &ldquo;It's
	the biological part of the scan that's tricky to get right.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well I think you must have
	got it right.  I don't feel any different!&rdquo; Craig exclaimed. 
	&ldquo;I feel like I still have a physical body somewhere and I'm
	just instanced into this virtuality through the mesh.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The woman called Kara waved her
	hand in a gesture eloquent of impatience.  &ldquo;Of course you do. 
	This artificial dichotomy between Sings, who are 90-99%
	non-biological, and Full Sings, who elected to travel the whole 100%
	of the way, is something I consider a pointless fixation and
	personally find rather annoying.  The computational intelligence is
	for all intents and purposes identical.  We all access computing and
	data resources outside ourselves to augment our own capabilities as
	needed.  So what's the real difference?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Stefan raised an eyebrow and
	shrugged.  &ldquo;Well, one minor difference is that people like
	Craig who were scanned through Cronus don't have the option of
	retaining a biological part of their intelligence.  They become Full
	Sings by default.  In Craig's case that's not such a big leap, but
	it's going to be a whopper once we start talking about brain
	scanning people moments before their biological death, hundreds or
	maybe even thousands of years in the past, and bringing them
	forward.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No one in the room could bring
	themselves to disagree with him on that point.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin
	Turrell is here to see you, sir,&rdquo; a disembodied voice
	announced in the office.  A large grey-haired man was working behind
	the enormous oak desk, reading something in the holo-monitor.  He
	did not look up, but sighed lightly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">All right, send him in,
	Peter,&rdquo; he said at last.  Less than a minute later, the office
	door opened and a man stepped in.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Senator Reynolds, it's very
	good to see you again,&rdquo; Justin said.  He crossed the carpet
	and shook the senator's hand, as the latter rose from his chair to
	meet him at one side of the desk.  Justin looked much as Reynolds
	had seen him appear in the past: middle height, sandy hair and pale
	eyes, athletic but compact frame.  His handshake was firm and
	sincere.  As always, Reynolds was a bit haunted by the knowledge
	that the apparently human body of the man he was now gesturing into
	one of the plush chairs situated in front of his desk was only the
	simulacrum of a man, like a mere suit that the real Justin had
	donned for this meeting.  To the extent that you could say that
	there actually was a real Justin anymore, of course.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">On his side, Justin saw a man who
	appeared bluff and hearty, with a mildly booming voice and a
	slightly folksy manner, who must have selected his thick, perfectly
	coiffed grey hair as a deliberate affectation calculated to add
	weight and wisdom to his appearance; no one in today's world of
	somatic gene therapy had to endure the visible signs of aging unless
	he or she wished to.  Still, the man was a Mosh &ndash; for Mostly
	Original Substrate Human &ndash; a widely used term denoting a
	person who had made little or no cybernetic additions to their
	biological body.  No nanocomputers in his brain to augment his
	memory and intelligence, or link him seamlessly into the global
	mesh, for example.  Robert Reynolds was a popular senator
	representing the northwestern Second District in the Senate of the
	North American Federation, a somewhat loosely defined federal
	republic which existed in the regions of the North American
	continent formerly claimed by the United States, Canada, and
	northern Mexico.  Justin was here because there were still a
	significant number of people, not all of them Moshes, who accepted
	the claim of that organization to be the legitimate government.  And
	because he regarded Reynolds as a politician who was not altogether
	dishonest, self-serving, vindictive, crazy, or lost.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Should I address you as
	Mister Ambassador, Justin?&rdquo; Reynolds quipped as he returned to
	his seat behind his desk.  Justin smiled and chuckled a little.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You know I can't be the
	Sing ambassador, Senator, because we're an anarchic society that
	isn't organized along hierarchical lines.  There's nobody to issue
	me with any credentials, I'm afraid.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds returned the chuckle. 
	&ldquo;That's all right, you'll do.  I know you'll report back to
	your society as you call it, and that they'll listen to you, which
	is all I need.&rdquo;  Justin gave a slight shrug and nodded,
	bringing the pleasantries to an end.  </FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I know you
	like to get right to the point, so I'll oblige you on that.  The
	fact is, we're experiencing some shortages.  Nothing too serious yet
	mind you, but we don't like the way the projections are trending. 
	The Life Necessities program is facing what may be a hard winter. 
	We'll need more MM and computing resources in order to cope.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What's the problem,
	increased demand?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You got it.  We think
	they're coming from Asia this time.  Don't suppose it really matters
	though,&rdquo; Reynolds added, almost as if he were a bit
	embarrassed to hear himself saying such a thing.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The past thirty years had not been
	easy ones for public servants.  Over the centuries, governments had
	made themselves the principal suppliers, and frequently the sole
	monopoly purveyors, of various important social commodities, viz.,
	national defense and border security, currency, transportation and
	energy infrastructure, law enforcement and courts, education,
	medical care, retirement funding, emergency services, social safety
	nets, and even nifty extras like parks and museums.   That the
	people would ever turn away from government in general, given such a
	laundry list of socially vital commodities and services which it
	provided to its citizens, was simply unthinkable.  Complain about
	taxes, the infringement of traditional civil liberties, and the
	impact of regulations, sure.  But turn away from government
	fundamentally?  No way.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yet technological development in
	the twenty-first century had systematically knocked these props out
	from under the edifice of the state one by one.  Beginning in the
	2010s, technology had yielded micro-fission, nanosolar and later
	fusion energy units which allowed almost any quantity of power to be
	generated piecemeal anywhere that it was needed.  Communications
	gradually became fully wireless, eliminating utility grids. 
	Molecular manufacturing using nanotechnology, or MM, now made it
	possible to manufacture, on location, practically anything for which
	one possessed the atomic-level digital blueprint, from a Caesar
	salad to a refrigeration unit to a glass of water, out of base raw
	materials such as carbon-rich biomass, soil, water, and energy. 
	Given a sufficient modularity of design, even large and complex
	structures such as homes could be created and assembled using
	relatively compact MM units.  As a result, digital information
	eventually became 99.9% of what you needed to manufacture almost
	anything; and naturally, information could be transmitted wirelessly
	anywhere in the world in less than a second.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not that it was necessary for
	humans to travel in the physical world all that frequently.  By 2030
	most traveling was done in the virtual worlds of the cyberverse. 
	People could meet, talk, work, play, conduct business, go shopping,
	attend concerts, visit relatives, tour precise simulations of real
	places, participate in historical re-enactments, go on romantic
	getaways, take vacations, and even explore whole new designer worlds
	and synthetic civilizations created by skilled designers and
	sustained by artificial intelligence &ndash; all by means of
	full-immersion virtual reality environments, simulations so good
	that one literally could not tell the difference by means of sensory
	perception alone.  Farewell to office buildings, shopping centers,
	commuting, and traffic jams, along with most of the motivation for
	humans to concentrate their population in large cities.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Biotechnology had provided
	engineered negligible senescence by the mid 2020s, virtually
	eliminating degenerative disease and effectively making aging a
	lifestyle choice.  What biotech did not provide, medical nanobots
	supplied a few years later.  Accidents rapidly became the leading
	cause of death for all age groups.  &ldquo;Retirement&rdquo;
	effectively ceased to have any meaning.  Life became a series of
	serial episodes, with many beginnings but no definite end.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">With the transformation of the
	substance of global commerce into the exchange of digital
	information &ndash; which of course could be suitably encrypted &ndash;
	the ability of governments to tax economic activity evaporated.  The
	old global currency system, which based the value of money on the
	future ability of governments to tax their subject economies,
	consequently collapsed in a brutal fugue of repeated hyperinflations
	and revaluations.  A series of competing free-market digital payment
	systems arose to take its place.  These were usually based on finite
	stocks of precious metals such as gold and silver, as both a unit of
	value and a unit of account.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Today the primary constituents of
	new value being created were unique patterns of information and the
	computing cycles or raw materials with which to instantiate them in
	virtual or 3D reality, respectively.   As productive economic
	activity occurred, the price of all existing resources slowly
	dropped.  This effectively made everyone gradually richer.   The
	incentive structure was perfect, and the exact opposite of the old
	government system of fiat money and taxes, in which the productive
	were penalized and everyone gradually became poorer rather than
	richer over time, due to the lifelong ravages of currency inflation.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Even worse, from a governmental
	perspective, was the fact that communities much larger than the
	family or immediate neighborhood evolved into intentional
	communities, based around shared interests gathered and practiced in
	virtual realities.  Communities and tribes could and did span the
	globe, embracing all nations, races, cultures, ages, and beliefs. 
	The loyalty of people to communities which they themselves had
	chosen proved to be much stronger than their loyalty to mere
	accidents of genetic or cultural inheritance, and particularly to
	the mere geographic location of their birth.  Consequently the very
	concept of a nation state with physical borders was rapidly
	discarded, once its socio-economic significance had been
	obliterated.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Those

	government; it had merely </SPAN></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>tolerated</I></SPAN></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><SPAN LANG="en-US">
	it.  And with the perceived value of the government's services at
	ebb, that tolerance was swiftly withdrawn.  It is a truism that no
	ruler or system of governance, no matter how despotic, possesses any
	power which is not ultimately derived from the inherent propensity
	and willingness of its own citizenry to obey.  In contemporary times
	most people, even a large number of Moshes, contumaciously
	disregarded government, correctly perceiving that it had essentially
	outlived its purpose.</SPAN></FONT></FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And ever since this had become the
	case, there had been no wars.  Even popes and patriarchs had always
	needed kings to sign on to their crusades.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The principal places where
	government retained some vestigial relevance were in the areas of
	law enforcement and courts (although private sector detectives and
	arbiters typically did a better job), and in providing a social
	safety net.  Government officials had finally been reduced to the
	ignominy of acting as actual public servants, rather than merely

	masters.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Given the incredible wealth and

	population of the planet using a mere tiny fraction of total global
	resources, this was a precept readily accepted by even the most
	rugged and die-hard of individualists &ndash; provided that any
	resources employed for charity were allocated to such uses
	voluntarily by their owners, of course.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Sings as a group, and the Full
	Sings as a subgroup, tended to be wealthy as such things went. 
	Which is to say that they controlled the allocation and deployment
	of a significant portion of the world's computing resources, held
	patents to a large number of inventions and digital copyrights to
	diverse items ranging from cookbooks and songs to the architectural
	blueprints of cities and palaces in virtual universes.  As a result
	they were good folks to ask if you wanted to raise funds for your
	charity.  Equally important, they were usually quite willing to help
	out when asked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Justin
	had been invited here by Reynolds so that he could put the touch on

	way to organize anything on a large scale, except violence? &ndash;
	but the fact was that the organization Reynolds represented was
	doing it, and it needed to be done.  It surely must have galled a
	government official to have to beg for money in the first place, let
	alone have to face the possibility that donations might cease if the
	donors decided they didn't like how their donations were being
	spent.  But Justin had decided a long time ago not to rub this into
	the noses of men like Reynolds, but instead to treat them, as a
	general rule, with the respect that they thought they deserved.</SPAN></FONT></FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As you say Senator, it
	doesn't really matter where they're coming from,&rdquo; he said now.
	 &ldquo;Can't have human beings starving or freezing to death in
	Federation territory, can we?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not on my watch, Justin,&rdquo;
	the Senator agreed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So what do you need to
	address the situation?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">About another two thousand
	MM units, standard size, with the regular base and trace element
	supply packs.  Then once we get the dwellings up, probably another
	fifty to a hundred thousand mesh jacks, along with the cycles to hot
	them.  We're going to be building a number of new residential
	communities in several local cities.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin nodded slowly.  &ldquo;I
	don't see that posing any real problem.  The Northwest Wireless
	Corridor Cooperative has just deployed computing capacity for
	another 450K transceivers, in advance of customer orders.  Building
	ahead of growth, you know.  I can talk to them, and I don't see why
	they wouldn't agree to donate the excess capacity, at least for the
	present.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds sat back in his chair. 
	&ldquo;Outstanding.  You're a lifesaver, literally.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin accepted the compliment
	with a mere eye blink.  &ldquo;But Robert, you didn't ask me here
	merely to tell me this.  You could have sent me a vidmail.  Hell,
	you could probably have sent it direct to the NWCC and gotten what
	you wanted without my intervention.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Senator Reynolds sobered slightly.
	 &ldquo;Yeah, I know.  What I wanted to discuss with you privately
	in person was a rumor, about something that happened recently to a
	certain individual.  I know you know I have my sources, and this is
	something with far-reaching implications.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin raised an eyebrow.  &ldquo;That's
	putting it mildly, if you're referring to the successful experiment
	with Craig Stenson.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	Craig Stenson, if you get my drift.&rdquo;</SPAN></FONT></FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin couldn't help smiling a
	tiny bit.  &ldquo;Oh, I think I do.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So what happened, exactly?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well as you may have heard,
	Stefan Jager's team recently perfected the Cronus Scanner. 
	Succinctly, it allows us to view and scan fourth dimensional
	coordinates, providing a window into the past.&rdquo;</FONT><DL>
		<DT><P>
		&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Passive viewing only,
		right?  You can't change the past?&rdquo;</FONT></DL>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Correct.  It works by
	tunneling through hyperdimensions, that is dimensions of the fifth
	or higher order.  The Scanner is projected to the desired four
	dimensional coordinates, and registers all matter and energy state
	changes down to the quantum level.  It's not time travel <I>per se</I>,
	merely a sort of image replication.  Physicists have theorized for
	decades that the universe is actually holographic, that is to say,
	written on a two-dimensional surface, with all the apparent higher
	dimensions being a mere illusion stemming from the density with
	which the information is encoded on the holographic surface.  The
	success of the Cronus Scanner suggests that this interpretation
	might be correct.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Can you see the future,
	then?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No.  From our frame of
	reference, that part of the hologram hasn't been written on yet.  So
	there's nothing to see.  The scan comes up blank.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>Thank
	God for small favors</I></SPAN></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><SPAN LANG="en-US">,
	Reynolds thought.  Aloud he said: &ldquo;So tell me about Stenson.&rdquo;</SPAN></FONT></FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He was a Sing, as you
	probably know.  A personal friend of the team, even.  Died in an
	accident caused by an earthquake in 2038.  Craig always intended to
	become a Full Sing once technology permitted, but of course he died
	a few years too soon.  The team quickly realized that the scanning
	resolution of Cronus was sufficient to handle a brain upload.  We
	tested it on a number of inanimate objects, then on plants and
	animals, and got nominal results on every test.  Craig was the final
	acid test of the technique.  We had the exact space and time
	coordinates at which his accident occurred, so setting up the
	Scanner was easy.   To make a long story short, it worked.  We did
	the quantum brain scan, and piped the data into the consciousness
	instantiation process &ndash; the same one that all the Full Sings
	have been through.  He's back with us now, in full possession of all
	of his memories and faculties.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So he exists as a pattern
	in a computer network somewhere, same as you do.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin smiled warmly.  &ldquo;Just
	so.  If I'm alive, then so is he.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The difference being of
	course that he was once dead.  You've never been dead.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin waved a hand to acknowledge
	the point.  &ldquo;True, I've never been dead.  My awareness is
	continuous without any gaps.  Unlike Craig, who's missing about six
	years.  He's been doing his best to catch up, of course.  I guess
	the question is whether someone living with such a discontinuity in
	their consciousness is to be classified as alive in some different
	sense than those of us who are living with none.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds sighed, suddenly finding
	himself feeling weary.  &ldquo;Yeah, that's one of the questions,
	Justin.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Another is obviously: can
	this be done, theoretically, for anyone who is dead?  The answer is:
	theoretically, yes it could.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds was silent a moment, his
	heart laboring in his chest.  &ldquo;But are they really alive,
	Justin!  Do you bring back their soul, or just an elaborate
	photocopy of their cell structure?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well, presumably the scan
	would be conducted before the individual actually passed away, so
	from the perspective of the person brought into the present day and
	instantiated, they never actually died at all.  That is after all
	more or less the point of the exercise.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I got that, but that's not
	what I'm asking.  I want to know whether they're alive after they
	get here.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That's like asking whether
	I'm alive.  I consider that I am.  But I'm not qualified to speak on
	whether some ineffable &ldquo;soul&rdquo; travels with the person
	forward in time, or perhaps fails to do so and passes on to its
	reward after the scan is completed and the biological body dies.  If
	you want to discuss such things, you'd do better to see a theologian
	than a digital information scientist.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds smiled ruefully.  &ldquo;It's
	the theologians who are going to want to talk to <I>you</I>.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Lovely,&rdquo; Justin said
	in a clipped tone.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin, you guys can't
	just&ndash;  Let me start again.  You understand this is &ndash;
	big.  Really a big deal.  To a lot of people.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Of course.  It's pretty big
	to us, too.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Fine.  That's good.  I'm
	just saying, there's going to be a lot of opposition.  It's going to
	lead to trouble.  The religious communities will all be up in arms. 
	There are people in the government, all the world's governments, who
	are going to want to prohibit this technology from being used.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Robert, you understand as
	well as I do that that's a ridiculous idea.  Even in the heyday of
	governments, prohibitions on the use of new technologies were
	generally dismal failures.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">All right, so maybe we're
	talking about voluntary relinquishment here, just like
	self-replicating nanobots were relinquished, because the fact is,
	this whole thing's just over the top.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin paused.  &ldquo;I'm a
	little surprised at you, my friend.  You're evidently refusing to
	consider what this could mean to so many people in a positive sense.
	 Your own wife Marguerite died some ten years ago.  You could have
	her in your life again.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Abruptly Reynolds was on his feet,
	the blood rushing to his face.  &ldquo;You can't bring her back to
	me!  She's gone!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin did not relent.  &ldquo;If
	we did it and she were here right now, she'd disagree with you. 
	She'd want you to accept her, admit that it was really her and say
	that you still loved her.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Just as abruptly, the Senator sank
	back down into his chair and put his head in his hands.  &ldquo;I
	know that,&rdquo; he said thickly after a moment.  &ldquo;But I
	don't think I could, don't you see?  It wouldn't really be her.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin now made his tone as soft
	and sympathetic as possible.  &ldquo;No, I don't think I do see.  Do
	you think this physical human body is any less real than yours? 
	You've shaken my hand.  We speak, we emote, we joke, we make eye
	contact.  I'm in the flesh, as biological as you are right now.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds lowered his hands and
	stared at Justin.  &ldquo;You also have a ton of nanites in your
	head linking that body to the rest of you that's all software
	running on a computer somewhere!&rdquo; he accused.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The same is true of many
	biological Sings, billions of people in fact, whose mind files exist
	partly on biological hardware and partly on digital hardware.  The
	only difference between myself and them &ndash; or between Craig
	Stenson and them &ndash; is that the cells of our biological bodies,
	when we choose to employ one, were assembled molecule by molecule
	inside an MM unit rather than being gestated in a womb, born, and
	slowly growing to maturity.  And of course we're not tied to our
	biological bodies; we can abandon or exchange them when we no longer
	wish to use them.  But any other presently biological human, even a
	Mosh, can make the same choice.  Anyone can become a Full Sing who
	wants to.  So long as it's a matter of informed conscious choice, of
	course.  Which, by the way, is definitely an ethical issue when
	we're talking about scanning the dead.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin, I can't argue with
	you.  I understand that you think you're still alive, but to me what
	you're describing doesn't sound like human life.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The essence of human life
	is a persistent pattern, not a body.  You're a Mosh, and yet all of
	the constituent atoms that make up your body turn over almost
	completely in the span of a few years at most.  And yet you're the
	same man, because your pattern persists.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds sighed again.  &ldquo;I
	know all the Sing propaganda, and I'm sure you know all the Mosh
	propaganda.  We're not going to resolve this debate today.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm certain you're right.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I just wanted to give you
	this warning, that you're going too far and it's going to cause real
	problems.  I want to urge you to think, use some of that super
	brainpower of yours.  There are some things it might just be better
	to stay the hell away from.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Okay, consider me warned. 
	Thank you for your time, Robert.&rdquo;  Justin stood up and held
	out his hand across the desk.  Senator Reynolds shook it solemnly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As always, thanks for your
	help.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No problem.  My pleasure.&rdquo;

	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Brigham took a
	deep breath and executed a few quick pitches with his long-handled
	spade, making the dirt pile up in the wheelbarrow behind him.  He
	could hear Joshua coming back down the tunnel toward him trundling
	an empty one.  The lighting was pretty dim and the damp was killer. 
	Brigham let out his breath as he emptied a final shovelful onto the
	pile just as Joshua rolled up.  Then he stopped, heaved a sighing
	breath and leaned on his shovel for a moment.  Joshua gave a
	half-sigh of his own as he observed that the next wheelbarrow was
	already mostly filled.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Heh, feel free to slow down
	a bit there, Brig,&rdquo; he commented with a note of mock sarcasm.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Nothin' doin' Josh, I want
	this job finished quick as we can.  We've been down here every night
	for what, two weeks now?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yeah, 'bout that.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well I want it done
	yesterday.  Wonder how far we've got to go?&rdquo;  Brigham turned
	around to stare at the earthen wall where their shovels had been
	biting out chunks to spill down onto the dirt floor of the tunnel.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Dunno.  Can't be much
	further though, based on the measurements.&rdquo;  Experimentally
	Joshua picked up a long thin metal rod and drove its end into the
	soft earth ahead at chest level.  It went in about eighteen inches
	and thunked against something.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The two men exchanged a startled
	look, and Josh exchanged the rod for another spade.  Together they
	carved dirt off the wall onto their feet in a big pile.  Soon they
	had uncovered a section of vertical concrete running perpendicular
	to their tunnel.  It looked unmistakably like part of the foundation
	of a building.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yee-ha!  Jesus, Mary and
	Joseph, we're there!&rdquo; Brig exclaimed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Team 28, mission
	accomplished!&rdquo; Josh added, and they paused for a celebratory
	high five.  Then they sobered a bit as they stared at the wall
	ahead.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Maybe we should be a little
	quieter,&rdquo; Brig suggested.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yeah, maybe.  Couldn't
	hurt, just to be on the safe side.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As they continued to load the
	wheelbarrows and uncover the wall ahead, being careful not to knock
	against it with their tools, each man retreated into his thoughts. 
	They'd been digging down here for weeks now, tunneling toward this
	building from the old city sewer access, like prisoners digging an
	escape tunnel or thieves planning a heist from a bank vault.  But
	they were neither.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Josh and Brig were Moshes, or as
	they liked to think of themselves, real men as God intended.  They
	were following orders, given to them by representatives of a secret
	society, the Knights of Jesus, which they hoped someday to join. 
	The building to whose foundation they had built their tunnel was a
	major hidden computing center here in Kansas City, home to thousands
	of networked CPUs and data storage arrays.   Some staggering
	quantity of petabytes and exacalcs was humming away on the other
	side of that wall.  In the old days such things were called server
	farms.  The modern term was &ldquo;brain house.&rdquo;  The change
	in nomenclature reflected the fact that computers formerly ran
	software that &ldquo;served&rdquo; human users; but with the advent
	of strong AI and humans who were Sings, computers now ran software
	which supported a kind of bodiless consciousness, that resided
	physically in secret places like this.  In a nutshell Josh and Brig
	were here because they, and the people who'd sent them, didn't
	believe that there were actually any brains in there.  </FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Plan, as they
	understood it, was to dig tunnels like these right up to the
	foundations of brain houses all around the world.  Josh and Brig
	weren't going through that wall tonight, or any night.  Their job
	was to prepare the way for a future team of demolitions experts and
	commandos, who would one day break into that building and puree the
	electronic &ldquo;brains&rdquo; living inside it right good.  This
	would be done simultaneously all over the world for maximum effect.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In their digging work, nothing but
	manual tools could be used.  No bots, no power tools, no blasting;
	just basic shovels and hammers and picks and wooden braces, powered
	by human muscles only.  Neither man was permitted to have any
	nanobot hardware in his body, and both had been scoped carefully by
	a medical team to make sure before they were given the assignment. 
	Even though respirocites and muscle nanites would have given them
	vastly greater strength and endurance and made the work go much
	faster, the risk of detection was just too great.   Or at least that
	was what they'd been told.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The two men suspected there was
	also another unspoken reason: making sure they were completely
	unaugmented was the only way to be one hundred percent certain of
	their loyalty.  Getting your performance enhanced with cybernetic
	implants was a slippery slope.  Next thing you know you'd be zombied
	out in their damned virtualities, spending all your time living in
	an unreal paradise where your every wish could come true, and
	forgetting about all the important stuff back in the real world. 
	God.  Family.  Country.  Your woman.  Your children.  Sunsets and
	rainstorms, real ones.  Birth and death and work and play, pleasure
	and pain, sickness and health.  No, Joshua and Brigham didn't really
	mind doing all this work with their bare hands.  They preferred it
	that way, aches and pains and all.  Besides, the Knights of Jesus
	didn't take members that weren't one hundred percent pure human as
	the day they were born.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">All their meetings with the KOJ
	people had always been face-to-face, never by means of any
	electronic communication.  And the KOJ folks always scoped public
	places for bugs before even opening their mouths to say word one,
	too.  They were good.  They were sharp and they were thorough.  They
	were careful and patient.  There was no way in hell the Sings were
	going to see this coming.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Brig and Josh had heard about the
	latest outrage.  Now the cyborgs were claiming they could raise the
	dead and upload them into their happy virtual paradise.  They were
	planning to do this for people's lost loved ones, important figures
	from history, someday even for all the average Joes throughout time.
	  Some wag in the media had even coined a mockingly sacrilegious
	buzzword for it: &ldquo;The Last Trumpet Project.&rdquo;  But to do
	all that they'd need a lot more computing resources, way more
	processing and storage to host all the minds of the dead alongside
	those of the living.   The cyborgs wanted to expand the brain houses
	into the dormitories of the entire human race, both the quick and
	the dead.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif"><I>Well the mansions of my people
	aren't in a building on this Earth, they're in heaven in the next
	world</I>, thought Joshua angrily as he wheeled another barrowfull
	of dirt down the tunnel to dump it along the disused sewer.  <I>And
	someday your brain houses will burn and you'll all find yourselves
	living in hell.  Won't you be surprised?</I></FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Suddenly Joshua was surprised, to
	hear movement in the tunnel behind him.  He froze for a moment, then
	set down his wheelbarrow quietly and turned, drawing a pistol from
	his jacket pocket.  Nothing fancy by modern standards, but
	functional, and a simple bullet could still make quite a mess of a
	man.  He headed back along the sewer to where their tunnel branched
	off.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The intruder, whoever it was, now
	seemed to be standing motionless at the mouth of their tunnel. 
	Joshua slowed his pace cautiously, nervously aware that they must
	have heard him approaching.  He stopped about ten paces away,
	squinting at the dark silhouette and holding his gun close to his
	body so that the other person wouldn't see that he was pointing
	something at them.  Of course, that could well be working both ways
	in the dimness.  He dared not shout out a warning to Brigham, whose
	shovel he could still hear grating faintly down the passage.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The peace of Christ be with
	you, brother,&rdquo; said the dark figure, softly but calmly.  Josh
	relaxed but not altogether.  This was a KOJ greeting, he knew &ndash;
	but so might anyone else.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Who are you, brother?&rdquo;
	he answered.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Shawn.  That's Joshua,
	isn't it?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Josh relaxed a bit more, took a
	few steps closer.  &ldquo;Sure is,&rdquo; he answered.  The man
	ahead switched on a flashlight, aimed at his own face.  Then he
	switched it off.  Josh recognized him, so he put away his gun,
	walked over, and offered his hand.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Shawn shook it, then looked
	apologetic.  &ldquo;Sorry to drop in on you unannounced, but it was
	necessary.&rdquo;  Shawn was one of their KOJ contacts, so Josh
	shrugged off the apology.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No problem.  What's up?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We needed a progress
	report.  Time's beginning to run out.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well you'll be happy to
	hear we hit pay dirt tonight.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That's great, just great. 
	Please show me.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sure thing, follow me.&rdquo;
	 Josh led him down their tunnel, which ran almost straight back for
	a bit less than fifty yards.  Every couple of yards the walls and
	ceiling were buttressed with wooden timbers.  The passage was wide
	enough for two, maybe three men to walk abreast.  The floor was
	hard-packed and marked by wheels and boots, the walls softer, the
	ceiling irregular but not crumbling.  Brig's shovel had ceased
	making noise up ahead.  Doubtless he had heard their voices.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Brother Shawn picked a good
	night to check up on us,&rdquo; Josh said as they reached the
	tunnel's end.  An expanse of concrete wall was now visible, almost
	man high.  Shawn shook Brig's hand as well, his face now clearly
	recognizable in the brighter lantern light they'd been using to work
	by.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Outstanding, guys,&rdquo;
	Shawn said.  &ldquo;Perfect in fact.  Your timing couldn't be
	better.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Getting close, eh?&rdquo;
	Brig inquired.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sure is.  They don't tell
	me the whole timetable, but I know it's getting near when they ask
	me to check up on all the tunnel teams in the area.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It's that Last Trumpet
	outrage, I expect,&rdquo; Josh said affecting a knowing air. 
	&ldquo;They've gone too far.  It's gotta be stopped.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Shawn nodded grimly, then laughed
	suddenly.  &ldquo;You know, in the Bible, Joshua blew a different
	sort of trumpet, and the walls of Jericho came tumbling down.&rdquo;
	 Brig thought this was just too funny and clouted Josh on the
	shoulder and laughed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You're gonna blow those
	Sing bastards' wall right down, Joshua,&rdquo; he said.  Josh
	chuckled too, though he felt a sudden warm surge of pride that made
	him feel taller somehow.  The damp tunnel suddenly seemed cramped.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Don't expect we'll be here
	when that happens,&rdquo; he allowed modestly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No,&rdquo; Brother Shawn
	agreed.  &ldquo;But I'm to tell you that it's time a couple of fine,
	true men like yourselves got taken into the KOJ.  You're invited to
	apply for membership.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Brigham and Joshua exchanged a
	glance.  Well hot damn.  Pay dirt indeed.  God was calling them to
	take the next step toward bringing back His world.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We'd be honored, Brother

	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The sea appeared
	to have a slight lavender tinge to it, though that could have been
	an effect borrowed from the sky, from which the auburn sun had but
	lately departed, leaving the western horizon draped in a layer of
	bronze that shaded quickly to indigo.  The calm waters broke in
	gentle, sighing waves upon the shore of a promontory thrust out from
	the mainland.  The promontory was hilly, with smooth grassy slopes
	dotted here and there with darkling trees.  A tall jagged tower was
	built on its top, leaning out over the sea in a buttressed zig-zag
	like an arm stretching out over the ocean.  A gravel path led across
	the narrow isthmus of land connecting the promontory with the
	mainland, and swept up to the tower door.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin piloted his hover-scooter
	along the coastline to strike that path.  As he drifted down the
	sandy and rocky beach, he observed many seashells of various shapes
	and colors and sizes, and glimpsed strange but graceful fish
	sculling in the pools.  The grasses were studded with flowers in
	pastel hues shaped like diamonds or hexagrams.  As he gained the
	path and sped along it several inches above its surface, he could
	see that many of the pebbles paving it contained what looked like
	flecks of mica or quartz.  The air felt like late spring or early
	summer in a northern latitude.  A few birds &ndash; some type of
	seagull, probably &ndash; skirled around the tower before diving
	toward the water below.  He could see no deer or other herbivores,
	though this slope variegated with thickets looked like a place one
	could expect to encounter some.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He reached the closed door of the
	tower.  It was made of heavy wood with stone lintels.  While
	wondering briefly whether he ought to knock, he noticed a balcony or
	parapet high above that had someone standing on it.  So instead he
	switched his hover-scooter into a vertical flight mode and rose
	slowly toward the ledge high above.  It was helpful not to look down
	while ascending, despite the complete lack of any real danger.  The
	figure of the man on the ledge above him had turned, had seen him,
	and was now beckoning him on.  Justin came to rest on a platform
	just below the tower's top-most turret, and calmly stepped out of
	his scooter, reaching out to shake the hand which his host offered
	to him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Glad that you could come,&rdquo;
	the man said as Justin arrived.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No trouble,&rdquo; Justin
	replied.  &ldquo;In fact I wanted to see how it was coming along.&rdquo;
	 He looked around the platform, which was plainly an observation
	deck of some kind, commanding a near 360-degree view of the
	surrounds.  There was a sturdy stone railing around it at waist
	height, and it was furnished with some heavy-looking round tables
	and chairs, equipped with central umbrellas, presently folded up for
	storage.  One could see out to sea on two sides, and back over the
	promontory to the mainland.  There, rolling woods dotted with
	clearings undulated to the face of low mountains a few miles inland,
	where there were white, chalky cliffs that capped the horizon in
	that direction.  Stars were beginning to appear in the easternmost
	quarter of the sky.  The platform was a dizzy eyrie perhaps five
	hundred feet above the tower door, and felt like it was floating in
	space.  Only the entrance to the tower's highest turret on one side,
	and the winding stair descending into the floor on the side
	opposite, provided a welcome sense of being anchored to something.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin's host let him take in his
	surroundings, saying nothing further.  &ldquo;Magnificent view, and
	kind of an eerie feeling up here,&rdquo; Justin commented after a
	moment.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He grinned.  &ldquo;Thanks.  Yeah,
	that was the idea.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov, you're a genius. 
	But you don't need me to tell you that.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov shrugged, and grinned
	broadly again.  He was a very tall black man, wiry-haired, with
	rather knuckled brows and such massive shoulders that he always
	looked slightly hunched, even though he stood perfectly straight.  
	His voice was a light baritone, not at all the growling bass one
	might expect from his appearance.  Petrov had always looked like a
	beardless black dwarf grown to giant size, yet he must have been
	basically comfortable with his appearance, since he had never really
	changed it upon becoming a Full Sing.  Justin watched the shadows of
	evening deepen over land and sea for a moment, then sighed with
	appreciation and turned from the view.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So how much of this world
	is complete?  And what do you call it, by the way?  You only sent me
	a cyberverse address.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well, most of the planet's
	designed, roughed in at least, land masses, topographical features,
	climate, landscape.  Not all of the flora and fauna are complete,
	but major species in each niche have been assigned for most areas. 
	The only part that's actually running right now is this section here
	where I've been working on the detail design, say about a hundred
	square miles.  I wanted to have at least one region that would
	really stand up, you know?  All the details just right.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It's very impressive,&rdquo;
	Justin said nodding.  &ldquo;Amazing detail.  Are there any
	habitations?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not yet, not to speak of. 
	Just a little village down the south coast a ways, and this tower
	here.  Later I'll do a big city island out off the coast here, and
	add a marina to the nearby fishing village.  I want the island to be
	big and bustling, a regular Hong Kong.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin smiled.  &ldquo;Shanti does
	like her nightlife at times.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Heh,&rdquo; Petrov agreed. 
	&ldquo;She does.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Planning to use any custom
	AIs?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov shook his head.  &ldquo;No,
	I'll just run standard libraries for the NPCs and the higher
	animals.  I'm not big on customizing that aspect much.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No, your specialty is
	breathtaking natural environments.  And you've truly outdone
	yourself here.  Place has a real nice feel to it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Eutropia,&rdquo; Petrov
	murmured.  &ldquo;That's what I'm calling it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Perfect.  I'm sure your
	wife will enjoy it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Hope so,&rdquo; he said
	with an impish, almost shy smile.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov was one of the most highly
	regarded virtual world designers anywhere.  Anyone could use a
	world-CAD program to generate fractal geometry that had a reasonably
	organic feel to it.  But Petrov applied smoothings and variances as
	only a master artist could, adding color, texture, and exhilarating
	details right down to the shapes of leaves and shells on the beach,
	distinctive forms of animals and plants, and subtle effects of light
	and shadow and sound and scent, culminating in landscapes and
	seascapes and cityscapes which evoked deep moods and profound
	feelings.   Hundreds of millions of visitors had zoned into world
	spaces he'd designed, and they kept coming back for more.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The demand for <FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">entr&eacute;e</FONT>
	to his works had made Petrov rich from zone access fees and instance
	royalties, but Justin knew it wasn't to gain more wealth that he had
	begun work on this latest creation, Eutropia.  It was really all a
	present for his wife Shanti, the person dearest to him in all the
	world, and in truth almost the only person whose artistic approval
	he genuinely sought.  Justin was confident that she would love it. 
	He was much less confident whether Petrov would be willing to make
	any part of Eutropia available for what Justin had in mind, or
	alternatively to work on something else which was about to become
	considerably more pressing.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You know I didn't come here
	just to admire the view,&rdquo; Justin began.  Petrov's smile faded.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I know.  You appreciate
	good art as well as the next man, but you've usually got something
	else on your mind.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin laughed.  &ldquo;Guilty as
	charged, I'm afraid.  I need your help.  <I>We</I> need your help,&rdquo;
	he amended, meaning of course the other Full Sings, among whom
	Justin was often a sort of unofficial ringleader or spokesman. 
	&ldquo;You've no doubt heard about what's being dubbed the Last
	Trumpet Project.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov snorted.  &ldquo;Naturally,
	I've heard about it.  So Stefan's raising the dead, and you've come
	to me because you want me to design a Heaven for them all to live
	in, more or less.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Something like that. 
	Though I don't think we'd want just one, since practically every
	individual would have their own idea of what their paradise ought to
	look like, anyway.  The real point is that we'll be needing to
	expand the cyberverse by leaps and bounds.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The cyberverse was the system of
	virtual worlds which were hosted in cyberspace.  Physically,
	Eutropia was a mathematical projection running inside a VPN (virtual
	private network) on a server cluster composed of high-speed
	computers and data stores which were owned by Petrov.  Justin and
	Petrov, being Full Sings, were themselves hosted on networked
	computers in brain houses elsewhere.  Since they were both in
	possession of the correct cyberverse coordinates and the necessary
	encryption access keys, each of them could open a client channel to
	the Eutropia VPN, thus allowing a part of themselves &ndash; the
	portion dealing with sensory perception and awareness &ndash; to
	interface with Eutropia's server software so that they could
	directly experience existing in Eutropia's world.  Each of their
	bodily avatars was itself a simulation projected into Eutropia's
	mathematical model.  Petrov, naturally, had access permissions which
	Justin as a visitor did not, and which allowed him to make dynamic
	alterations to Eutropia's geometry and programming.  But since all
	of the data being exchanged between Justin and Petrov via Eutropia's
	servers was fully and unbreakably quantum-encrypted, it was also as
	good a place as any to have a very private conversation.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well, so how many dead
	people is Stefan planning to Cronus Scan in the near future?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You just wouldn't believe
	the demand, Petrov.   Oh sure, the Moshes are pretty upset about it,
	we knew they would be, but almost everybody else is ecstatic.  We
	haven't even offered to scan a single person's dead relative, and
	yet already there are advocacy groups forming that have assembled
	lists with millions of names on them.  Some of them are even taking
	pledges for computing resources to help share the load, sensibly
	enough.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov shook his head ponderously.
	 &ldquo;There can't possibly be enough cycles out there.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We're aware of that, and
	the problem's being worked on, on several fronts.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It took a massive amount of
	computing power to host every Full Sing.  Most people who were Sings
	still had biological brains, albeit augmented with a great deal of
	local computing power in the form of trillions of networked
	nanocomps resident in their brains and bodies.  Such persons
	functioned like self-contained software clients which interfaced to
	sophisticated server programs like Eutropia only when the individual
	was zoned into a full immersion virtuality experience.  The rest of
	the time, they required very little hosting load.  The (so far) tiny
	minority of Sings who had become Full Sings, and been uploaded
	entirely onto faster and more durable substrates, required a great
	deal of additional computing power to host their uploaded
	consciousness, and they required it continuously.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The fastest computers available in
	2044 measured their computing capacity in terms of zetacalcs, or
	10<SUP>21</SUP> calculations per second (cps).  But most computers
	in brain houses around the world were still running the previous
	generation technology, which only offered exacalcs, or 10<SUP>18</SUP>
	calculations per second.  It required roughly 10<SUP>19</SUP> cps to
	emulate the function of a single purely biological brain (i. e. that
	of a Mosh), and anywhere up to a thousand zetacalcs (10<SUP>24</SUP>
	cps, also known as a yottacalc) to completely support the vastly
	augmented brain of a Full Sing.  Practically speaking, this meant
	that Full Sings had to reside on nothing but clusters of the fastest
	computers available.  As did the very best virtual environment
	simulations such as Eutropia, which mathematically modeled not only
	the usual coarse 3D geometry and spatial relationships using fractal
	tiles, but minute perceptual details right down to individual grains
	of sand and dust motes in the breeze.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The basic problem was that every
	person scanned from the past was necessarily going to be
	instantiated as a Full Sing, potentially consuming just as many
	compute cycles as a Justin or a Petrov.  And there were potentially
	billions of them who could be so scanned, over time.  Each of whom
	would of course need places in the cyberverse in which to live,
	work, play, and create.  Justin was here to enlist Petrov's help in
	a project which was daunting even to a genius designer of entire
	worlds.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So what do you want from me
	Justin, a pile of instance licenses for Eutropia?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not necessarily for here. 
	What would this world require to host if you finished it out
	planet-wide and brought it all online?  Just curious.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov thought for only a moment. 
	&ldquo;A few hundred yottacalcs, give or take some.  Add at least
	one additional zetacalc per inhabitant.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin whistled.  &ldquo;Whew.  To
	say nothing of the transfer bandwidth.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yeah.  You're talking
	terabits per second, even with full compression.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">All that detail
	granularity.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yep.  You sure you don't
	want to put these resurrected dead folks into some off-the-shelf
	low-resolution paradise somewhere?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin laughed heartily.  &ldquo;Sure,
	but it's not about where I'm going to put them.  It's about where
	they're going to want to put themselves.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov didn't argue the point. 
	The right of sentient beings to self-determination was perhaps the
	one value judgment which was shared by practically every Sing. 
	Respect for the peaceful choices of others was the basis of all
	civilized behavior.  There came a point at which a developing
	intelligence naturally became compelled to respect the intelligence
	of its neighbors.  Making choices for others implicitly assumed that
	they were too stupid to make their own choices for themselves. 
	Which, in a world replete with intelligences augmented many
	thousands of times beyond the biologically human, was in itself a
	distinctly unintelligent &ndash; and profoundly arrogant &ndash;
	assumption to make.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well then, let them get
	educated and start working on the solutions we all need,&rdquo;
	Petrov suggested.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That of course is an
	excellent idea and has already been discussed.&rdquo;  Every
	computer genius, engineer, mathematician and physicist in recent
	history was potentially available for recruitment through the Cronus
	Scan.  After a period of adjustment and education, of course.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Have you considered
	instantiating them in biological bodies with suitable Sing
	augmentations?&rdquo; Petrov asked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The look on Justin's face plainly
	showed that actually, he hadn't.  &ldquo;I can see the benefit of
	that, at least as a stopgap measure.  Being biological is certainly
	what they're used to, at least if they're from very far in the past
	anyway.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">How far back can the Cronus
	reach?&rdquo; Petrov asked curiously.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">About fifty years, so far. 
	Beyond that, there's too much focus jitter for a viable quantum
	state scan, but Stefan thinks that can be eliminated and the
	temporal range extended.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well no big rush.  After
	all, how many people died in the past fifty years?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Plenty.  Including most of
	the ones that people alive today would like to see scanned.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Right.  So, what if you
	scan them and instantiate their pattern as a biological Sing? 
	Duplicate the cell structure of their original bodies in optimal
	condition, and do the same with their neurons and inter-neuronal
	connections, then fill in the gaps with nanocomps so they have
	complete memory recall.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Tricky,&rdquo; Justin
	mused.  &ldquo;MM can't manufacture brain cells with enough accuracy
	to vest full consciousness and memory.  When you or I take a
	biological body, we merely get all the brain's sensory and control
	wiring correct and then let the nanocomps drive the neurons to
	provide the higher brain functions, driven in turn by our higher
	substrate consciousness out-of-body.  You're proposing reducing the
	hosting load by offloading more of the brain function back down to
	the cellular level.  I'm not sure that can be done safely.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov shrugged.  &ldquo;Something
	else to work on, then.  Improving the accuracy of the MM assembly of
	brain cells.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Even if it worked, we don't
	really want the dead coming back as Moshes.  3D space isn't entirely
	stable, you know.  They might end up biologically dead again, unless
	we solve the problems that we really need to tackle.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov fell silent in thought,
	then looked troubled.  &ldquo;Justin, what about the element of
	choice?  How do we know that the dead, the dying, whatever, actually
	want to be scanned and brought into our modern world?  What about
	those who genuinely wanted to cease to exist, like suicides for
	example?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin sighed.  &ldquo;I've made
	that point many times, and so have others, including Stefan.  Right
	now our proposed protocol is going to look like this.  First,
	someone alive today has to nominate the deceased person for the
	Cronus Scan.  All of these requests will get prioritized somehow. 
	When a subject reaches the head of the queue, a preliminary scan is
	conducted to confirm that a full upload shortly before death is
	feasible.  Then during the scan itself, there's going to be a brief
	dialog phase with the subject before they are brought forward, to
	confirm that they are willing.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov frowned.  &ldquo;I thought
	it was impossible to make the scan interactive.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It is.  The dialog is with
	the personality after the scan, but before total instantiation.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I see.  You're going to
	buffer them up and instantiate them just enough to tell them what's
	going on and ask them if it's what they want.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And if they say yes, you
	complete the upload process, after which they're going to come and
	ask me for a nice designer afterlife world to live in,&rdquo; Petrov
	laughed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Something like that.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You always stir things up,
	Justin.  You're always pushing the envelope, somewhere, somehow.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Constantly pushing
	envelopes is what makes us human, my friend.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov's face clearly showed that
	he liked this thought.  &ldquo;True.  And I have to admit, I guess
	that's what I do myself.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Which is why I'm here,&rdquo;
	Justin said with the quirk of a smile and the suggestion of a bow.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No doubt.  Okay, I guess
	you can count on my help.  I'll think about some economical
	options.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">All I can ask.  Thanks.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Complete night had now fallen in
	the west, but it was getting lighter rather than darker.  Justin saw
	what he at first took to be a moon rising in the east, a round limb
	of light climbing up over the cliffs of the distant scarps.  Noting
	his attention, Petrov reached out in thought through a control
	interface and advanced the program governing the sky, weather, tides
	and lighting by an hour or two.  The object swept abruptly up the
	sky by about thirty degrees.  It was not a moon, but something more
	like a sister planet, with swirls of clouds, and oceans and
	continents visible  between them.  It hung in the heavens like the
	avatar of the unknown, a world visible but unreachable, forever
	mysterious, bathing the sunless landscape of Eutropia in a gentle
	variegated light of greens, blues, whites, and browns.  The calm sea
	below them shimmered as if dim rainbows were twisting slowly beneath
	its surface.  It was so beautiful that Justin's virtual body
	mimicked a purely biological reaction and briefly suspended
	breathing.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It's a double planetary
	system,&rdquo; Petrov explained unnecessarily.  &ldquo;Had a devil
	of a time getting the tidal effects and the lighting interactions
	right.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In a few moments Justin's avatar
	started breathing again.  &ldquo;Petrov, you're a total fucking

	functioned only on the dance floor, and inside the booths perched in
	the gallery that ringed it round.  This kept the couples gyrating
	orgiastically below from spinning off the dance floor, and kept
	their drinks from flying out of their glasses once they floated back
	up to their seats.   The club's architecture and decor had been
	jokingly, but not altogether unfairly, described as Gothic Early
	Maniac.  Darkly back-lit rectangular stained glass windows depicting
	decidedly unpleasant medieval events marched down the walls,
	occupying the higher third or so of the walls' height so as to loom
	over the patrons.  A steeply gabled roof high above, hung with
	countless spots and strobes and other lighting hardware, and
	Romanesque arches over all of the entrances and exits, completed the
	impression of a church &ndash; albeit a very profane one.  Where the
	altar should have been was what looked like a long bar made of
	silvery metal and outfitted with a couple dozen metal bar stools,
	all empty.  Behind the bar was no one, merely a huge spotlit statue
	of a knight in armor hoisting the severed head of an enemy in one
	hand and a jeweled wine goblet in the other.  The knight was
	grinning broadly as he toasted victory, vengeance, bloodlust,
	intoxication, or perhaps just good wine; it was hard to say which.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The music throbbing through the
	club, vibrating even in its very walls, fit the visual scene
	remarkably well: it was raucous, harsh, rhythmic and dissonant, a
	brutal, sex-charged ostinato which did not quite cover the high
	strains of an intermingled melody of surprising lyricism and
	sweetness, which sounded as though it were being sung by invisible
	angels doubled by distant guitars.  The lyrics, if there were any,
	were naturally unintelligible.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay Thorsten turned to the two
	women sharing his booth with him and shrugged eloquently, turning
	his palms up on the table.   In this sort of environment, pantomime
	perforce was raised to a singularly high level of sophistication
	among the patrons.   This particular shrug didn't mean &ldquo;I
	don't know what to do next,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;I just can't decide
	which one of you to take below for a smash dance,&rdquo; or even
	&ldquo;Why the hell did we come in here in the first place?&rdquo; 
	It meant: &ldquo;I have no idea why Torch hasn't shown up yet, but
	I'm beginning to get pissed off about it&rdquo; &ndash; and both
	women plainly interpreted it correctly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma, Clay's girlfriend, rolled
	her dark eyes a bit and then returned her attention to the action on
	the dance floor below, absently running her fingers through her
	silky black mane.  By which she meant, &ldquo;Yeah, this is getting
	stupid, but I'm prepared to sit it out for a while yet.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara, a friend of Salma's for a
	couple of years &ndash; blonder and blander than Salma, in Clay's
	book &ndash; and nominally the missing Torch's girlfriend, offered a
	dispirited, somewhat apologetic shrug of her own and a helpless hand
	wave.  Which conveyed, &ldquo;Well how do you think I feel?  Let's
	give him a bit longer.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay was willing to wait.  He was
	after all sitting next to two of the best looking girls in the club,
	and possibly, though it was hard to tell for certain, just about the
	only ones here at the moment who were players.  Most if not all of
	the rest were probably NPCs, or non-player characters, meaning
	avatars which were controlled by the club's AI rather than by other
	human patrons.  Like most cyberverse nightclubs, this one was
	programmed to spawn NPCs to supplement the crowd as needed so that
	the joint was always filled more or less to capacity.  But at least
	if you came in without a date you could always count on finding
	someone to hook up with.  The NPCs were of course able to recognize
	customers, and generally speaking were programmed to be, well,
	rather accommodating.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That wasn't Clay's preferred
	company, though.  He liked to know that there was a real human
	female somewhere out in meatspace whose mind was controlling the
	avatar he was with, for conversation as well as sensual activities. 
	 His own avatar that he'd chosen for the evening was actually based,
	though not strictly, on the appearance of his meatspace body.  Which
	meant a man in his late twenties of above average height and a trim,
	athletic build, olive skinned with naturally curling dark brown hair
	and green eyes.  If his cyberverse avatar and his human self could
	be placed side-by-side, they could easily be mistaken for brothers,
	though certainly not for identical twins.  It was refinement rather
	than radical redesign that Clay had undertaken for his virtual self,
	the self in which he typically spent the bulk of his time.  That the
	differences were more superficial than profound was a source of no
	small pride for Clay, even though as a rule one had little reason to
	care about anybody's actual physical appearance in meatspace.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Whether Salma's virtual avatar
	similarly resembled her physical body he had no idea, since they had
	never even met in the flesh, but he certainly liked her virtual body
	well enough.  She was a striking Latina beauty with high cheekbones,
	full lips, wavy dark hair pinned back off her forehead, and an
	hourglass body that would look good in a burlap bag, still less in
	the shimmering and form-fitting velvet, leather, and satin outfits
	which she liked to wear.  Her present costume was almost demure: a
	kind of vaguely Renaissance green dress with ruffly sleeves, with a
	cloak worn over top of it.  The relatively high neckline barely
	hinted at cleavage (albeit, very deep cleavage).  The dress gathered
	tightly around her waist, then spilled over her hips down almost to
	floor length.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara was a little shorter than
	Salma, blond-haired with pale skin and bright hazel eyes, framed by
	long lashes.  Her slim body was clothed, or perhaps one ought to say
	sheathed, in a mostly black bodysuit made of some velour-like fabric
	which covered her from neck to hips, where it abruptly flared out
	into a skirt which draped her nice legs to mid-thigh.  It revealed
	absolutely no skin and yet displayed every contour of the body
	beneath.  The areas that weren't black were silver: a band around
	the throat, and two slashes diagonally across her body from
	shoulders to hips.  The taut silver fabric, while not exactly
	transparent, managed to leave absolutely no doubt as to the precise
	location and general dimensions of her large nipples.  Black boots,
	silver gypsy mode jewelry and a headpiece, almost like a coronet,
	pinning her pale hair back out of her face, completed her clubbing
	ensemble.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay's own clothing was simple,
	and generally complementary with what his date was wearing.  A sort
	of tunic under a jacket with some lace worked into it, casually open
	at the throat, and tightly fitting pants like hose, with a cape
	thrown overall.  All black of course, no color about him at all,
	except for a large bloodstone gold ring on his right hand.  The
	overall effect, quite deliberate, was a vaguely sinister yet plainly
	sensual air.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma turned her attention back to
	their booth and tapped on a touch panel at the back edge of the
	table.  A menu screen popped up and she pondered a moment, then
	entered something.  With a loud chime (barely audible under the
	circumstances) a matched set of three drinks slid out onto the table
	from within a panel.  Each of the three picked up a glass.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cheers,&rdquo; Salma
	mouthed as they all sampled her selection.  It tasted a bit like a
	white Russian, but with a prickly citrus-like aftertaste which Clay
	thought he recognized.   Since their virtual bodies didn't get
	thirsty unless that response was specifically enabled, this drink
	must have some other purpose.  Clay had his suspicions, knowing
	Salma.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">For the first few minutes, he felt
	only a mild buzz, as if he had just drunk a shot.  Then as he
	continued sipping his drink, a faint flushed feeling prickled on the
	backs of his hands and in his face.   While he drank slowly, the two
	women had clicked glasses and practically chugged their drinks in
	one long draft.  Sure enough, by the time his glass was empty the
	hot, flushed feeling had localized further down and he could feel
	his cock getting hard in his pants.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma smirked and said something
	inaudible, then reached impishly under the table to give his
	burgeoning manhood a playful squeeze.  Cylara noted the gesture and
	looked at Clay and laughed.  The points tenting the silver strips of
	her dress were now standing out like thumbs.  Clay rolled his eyes,
	not altogether faking his annoyance.  When Torch had set up this
	outing, he'd sounded like he'd had more in mind than just hooking up
	with the girls for some performance-enhanced sex.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Several of the NPCs exited through
	one of the arched stone doorways.  This sometimes presaged the entry
	of additional human patrons, as the club's controlling AI kept the
	population at the calculated ideal level.   Sure enough, a few
	moments later a man recognizable as Torch walked into the club.  He
	scanned the crowd and quickly picked out Cylara, who waved from
	their booth.  Torch stepped into the zero-G area and launched
	himself into space over the dance floor, needlessly swimming like a
	practiced fish through the air towards their booth.  As he reached
	it, gravity reasserted itself and he slid into a seat next to
	Cylara, who gave him a welcoming kiss and promptly captured his left
	hand in her lap.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch was an attractive young man
	in his middle twenties, on the tall side, crowned with a shock of
	flaming red hair which had earned him his nickname.  His face and
	body were lean and chiseled.  He wore a black silk shirt with
	expensive-looking dark jeans, topped by a sleek dark green leather
	jacket.  His glittering green eyes conveyed a serious expression. 
	He briefly shook Clay's hand with his free one, and nodded to Salma
	across the table.  She said something.  He half shrugged, meaning
	&ldquo;Sorry I'm late but there was nothing I could do about it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay leaned close and practically
	shouted into Torch's face.  &ldquo;Dude, so what's up?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">For answer, Torch reached into his
	jacket pocket and extracted something, which he placed face up on
	the tabletop.  It was a gleaming silver disc like a large coin,
	embossed with a few letters and numerals and a couple of polished
	spots which were plainly electrical contacts.  A cryptokey for
	somewhere in the cyberverse.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay turned the disc over to look
	at the mint symbols.  Incredibly, the number 1690783547938250818 was
	etched around the edge, indicating the data source.  This was the
	decimal equivalent of the hallmark commonly used by the Full Sings. 
	&ldquo;Holy shit!  It's Justin's seal,&rdquo; Clay marveled in a
	subdued tone that of course nobody heard.  He flashed the reverse
	side of the disc at each of the girls, allowing them to read it. 
	Their faces sobered and Salma raised an eyebrow at him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch reclaimed the disc from
	Clay's palm and held it up for a moment, shaking it in front of
	their eyes, then restored it to his pocket.  He also (regretfully)
	withdrew his other hand from between Cylara's satiny thighs.  This
	elicited a pouty look but no protest.  It was obvious the party was
	about to adjourn somewhere else.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay gestured in the direction of
	the nearest exit, which obviously meant &ldquo;Let's ramble.&rdquo; 
	The foursome got up from their booth and entered the zero-G area of
	the club, electing to hand-over-hand down the railings of a metal
	ladder to the ground floor, that being faster than floating over the
	dancers.  At length they were in a hallway that opened onto the
	club, headed for some revolving doors marked &ldquo;Lobby Exit.&rdquo;
	 On the center post of the doors was a palm scanner, which each of
	them pressed briefly with their palm.  This had the visible effect
	of shifting the doors so that they could leave, as well as the
	hidden effect of remunerating the club's operators for their use of
	the facilities.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In the plush and refreshingly
	quiet lobby were elevators leading to private rooms of varying
	descriptions whose general purpose was inferable.   What looked like
	a door to the street outside was unlit and appeared locked.  Very
	likely this particular virtual domain possessed but little
	implementation outside this immediate building.  There was also a
	circular sunken floor area near the middle of the lobby, with a
	metal pedestal standing in its center.  This was plainly the exit
	zone point, though it was not the place at which any of them had
	arrived.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was untenanted at present, and
	they all walked in and stood around the central pedestal.  Inset in
	its upper surface was a console incorporating a number of round
	depressions of various diameters and obscure labeling, into which
	cryptokey disks could be fitted.  Torch spun the Sing disc around in
	his fingers until he located one where it fitted exactly.  He
	pressed it face down into the reader and rotated it until it snicked
	into place.  Then he tapped a scan button.  After a moment,
	holographic letters appeared above the console, in a warning red
	script: &ldquo;Unable to zone to this destination from this
	location.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Crap,&rdquo; Torch said as
	he touched a release button and recovered his cryptokey.  &ldquo;Any
	ideas?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Why don't we try it from
	the Mall of the West?&rdquo; Clay suggested.  That made sense.  It
	was an extremely well-connected site.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Where is this place we're
	going to, anyway?&rdquo; Salma wanted to know.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I don't know,&rdquo; Torch
	admitted.  &ldquo;I've never been there before.  But the guy I got
	the key from claimed it was one of the new mansions of the dead, for
	the Last Trumpet Project.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay looked glum rather than
	excited.  &ldquo;And why did you believe him?  Who was he, anyway?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch smiled enigmatically.  &ldquo;A
	very good source, dude.  You saw the origin seal.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yeah.  Doesn't mean we're
	not on our way to Justin's garage, though.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch shrugged.  There was
	obviously no question that they were going anyway.  Clay produced a
	disc of his own, fitted it into the console.  This time the scan
	came up green: &ldquo;Zone point ready.&rdquo;  Clay retrieved his
	key disc.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Mall of the Western
	Hemisphere, here we come,&rdquo; he announced.  Each of them grabbed
	hold of a metal railing around the console pedestal, and seeing
	this, Clay depressed the ZONE button.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The club's lobby winked out into a
	blank grey nothingness, silent as only the space between worlds
	could be.  Their virtual avatars dropped their connections to the
	nightclub's servers, and negotiated a connection with the Mall's. 
	This took only a second or so, barely enough time to register the
	flickering sensory input of being in between realities.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Then abruptly they found
	themselves in a broad courtyard flagged with white marble paving
	stones.  High above, a hundred feet or more, a soaring glass roof
	supported by a spiderweb network of graceful steel beams let the
	sunlight of early afternoon flood the courtyard.  Efficiently cooled
	air breathed lightly on their faces, and gently rustled the leaves
	of the many large shrubs in planters along the margins of the vast
	room.  A hubbub of voices and footfalls greeted their ears,
	punctuated with calls and laughter and the occasional cry of a
	child, expressing delight or frustration at higher sound
	frequencies.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch spun around slowly and then
	immediately headed for a map kiosk.  The others followed.  There was
	absolutely no point in wandering around this place without knowing
	where you were going.  This Mall was so immense, that had it been
	constructed in meatspace it would have more than covered the former
	state of Rhode Island.  Growing up organically in the cyberverse, it
	now consisted of millions of stores occupying an aggregate virtual
	area of several hundred square miles.  Naturally, zone points
	occurred at frequent intervals along the various inter-connecting
	concourses.  Even in virtual reality, shoppers only liked to stroll
	so far.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As they stood around the map,
	Torch efficiently located the nearest external zone point and noted
	the route to it.  Salma wrapped an arm around Clay's waist and
	wiggled her other hand into his front pants pocket.   &ldquo;Glad to
	see you're still so happy to be with me,&rdquo; she said with a
	giggle.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay felt a brief surge of
	embarrassment and suppressed a groan.  He'd neglected to reconfigure
	his avatar for their new cyberverse location, and the effects of the
	aphrodisiac drink back in the bar were still partly lingering.  He
	did so now, activating with a thought a heads-up avatar control
	display that only he could see, on which he navigated to and
	selected &ldquo;clear arousal response.&rdquo;  Gad.  He must be
	more excited about going to this secret Sing location than he'd let
	on to Torch.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Thanks, hon,&rdquo; he said
	to Salma as they followed after Torch and Cylara.  The nearby zone
	point was marked out by differently-colored tiles, with the console
	controls recessed in a wall.  A family was using it, and the four
	young people waited courteously until they had all disappeared.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This time the scanning device,
	after a long moment, gave a favorable report of the mysterious Sing
	cryptokey.  &ldquo;Hot damn,&rdquo; Torch opined.  It had been a
	good idea to try zoning from here.  The Mall needed to accept
	zone-ins from the widest possible number of cyberverse locations, as
	well as to allow its customers to zone back to where they came from.
	 If this key did indeed lead into a future dwelling for the dead,
	well, the resurrected dead were going to need to go shopping just
	like other folks.  So it made sense that the destination would be on
	the list of permitted Mall access points.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Excitement spread visibly over
	Torch's face, and it was contagious.  They drew in close and grasped
	the zone bar.  Torch took a deep breath and pushed the ZONE button.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Team Five,
	good to go,&rdquo; came the voice over the speakers inside the
	aircar's luxurious but functional cabin.  Roger Sarner grunted,
	expressing exasperation while suppressing his mounting excitement. 
	&ldquo;About time.&rdquo;  He keyed the transmit button on his
	console.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Command to all teams: move
	in,&rdquo; he grated, and released the switch.  Transponder dots on
	his tactical map obediently started moving toward all entrances to
	the building which they had surrounded.  Whatever security the mall
	rats had in place was about to get a big surprise.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Roger Sarner, Secretary of
	Homeland Security for the North American Federation, was a large man
	of about fifty.  His graying military-style crew-cut complemented
	the harshly drawn lines of his face and his elegant dark suit to
	create a no-nonsense, all-business appearance.  Sarner prided
	himself on the rapport and easy-going camaraderie which he
	maintained with his men, but never during a mission.  At mission
	time he was as hard-ass as they come.  It wasn't usual for a
	Homeland Security Secretary to command a field raid in person, but
	Sarner had reached a point where he no longer gave a rat's ass what
	other Federation officials thought about his doing so.  Let them
	call him a cowboy or worse; he'd learned in a very hard school that
	the only way to get things done right was to go out and do them
	yourself.  And to hell with the wimps and anarchist sympathizers who
	got their hairnets in a twist.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Their target was a brain house in
	San Mateo, California.  The Bay Area had been a computing hotbed
	since before onetime U.S. Senator Albert Gore had made the tragic
	error of inventing the Internet back when.   Back in the days when
	the net was still &ldquo;cute&rdquo; and people mostly surfed it for
	nudie pics of actresses, most brain houses &ndash; or server farms,
	as they'd called them in those days &ndash; had been out front with
	what they were doing, even advertising and offering prospective
	customers tours of their state-of-the-art hosting facilities.  But
	as commerce became digital, and unbreakable encryption became
	ubiquitous, and everything including the backbones went wireless to
	avoid centralized control, the computer servers hosting the
	worldwide mesh gradually went underground and into hiding.   As
	exogenous commerce claimed a larger and larger market share, the
	computing infrastructure hosting virtual reality became increasingly
	invisible.  Nanosolar power and fusion generators, which eliminated
	the power utility grids, finished the job.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">When over the span of less than a
	decade the tax base melted away into the realm of exogenous digital
	commerce, desperate governments had no real way of pulling the plug.
	 Servers facilitating illegal tax-free economic activity
	(euphemistically called &ldquo;frictionless commerce&rdquo; by
	cyber-anarchists and their sympathizers) could be situated anywhere:
	in a store basement in Michigan, in a closet in Bangladesh, in a
	shed out in a Nebraska cornfield, in a mountain village in Peru &ndash;
	or under a mostly abandoned apartment house in San Mateo.  Operating
	even a tiny brain house could be a lucrative proposition if it
	carried enough traffic, lucrative enough that a lot of people around
	the world started doing it, despite the total illegality of it in
	most places.  Eventually it was the tax and official banking sectors
	that were exogenous to the rest of the world, which had moved its
	economic activity into the cyberverse, and left the authorities
	standing around outside it with their thumbs up their butts.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There was one known way to track
	illegal commerce to its hosting.  It involved the use of a bugged
	avatar.  You sent your man into the virtual store to transact some
	business, and then did some fancy traffic analysis to figure out
	where the packets going in and out of his mesh jack were coming
	from.  Onion routings, proxies, VPNs, and randomized packet
	forwarders made this task extremely difficult.  But occasionally
	somebody would be using some sloppy, second-rate routing software
	and a pattern would emerge which could be detected by Homeland
	Security's mesh traffic analysis AI, Ferret.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Today's target was extra special. 
	Not just some mom-and-pop operation hosting discount virtual Grand
	Canyon tours for the Sing kiddies, but what was probably some number
	of mainline stores located in the Mall of the Western Hemisphere  &ndash;
	 assuming Ferret had got its sums right.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Some years ago, when the Mall was
	getting to be a big deal, the government of the North American
	Federation had pointed out to the Mall folks that as the major
	legitimate government actually located in the western hemisphere, it
	was entitled to point-of-sale tax revenue from all sales
	transactions conducted in the said Mall.  The Federation Congress
	had passed a bill levying a five percent tax.  A mere five freaking
	percent!  And the Mall's Chamber of Commerce had actually taken a
	vote on it, and sent back an official reply stating that the
	Federation's assertion of jurisdiction was rejected and the tax
	would not be collected, since the association's members could find
	&ldquo;no legal or ethical justification for the mandatory diversion
	of any portion of Mall sales revenue to an external, non-member
	entity to whom the money does not belong.&rdquo;  Outrageous!  And
	the spineless sons of whores in the Congress just shrugged their
	shoulders and said there was nothing they could do about it, since
	there was no way they could enforce the tax anyway.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Roger Sarner was about to show
	them different.  His men were moving into the building now,
	advancing through every entrance simultaneously in order to prevent
	anyone inside from escaping.  The muffled sounds of the nearest
	team's forcible dynamic entry were audible from inside the command
	car.  Sarner looked over at his driver, the only other person in the
	car with him, and noticed him running an emergency liftoff check,
	just in case something went explosively wrong and they had to leave
	the scene in a hurry.   Sarner simply didn't trust AI pilots, which
	is why he always had a human one.  He gave the driver a nod of
	approval, which probably went unnoticed, and scrutinized his
	tactical console again.  All teams were fully inserted into the
	building now.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Contact! Team Two, suspect
	contact,&rdquo; a voice reported.  Sarner waited for more
	information before responding or giving instructions.  &ldquo;One
	male, one female, they're jacked in,&rdquo; the voice continued more
	calmly.  Casually, Sarner keyed his mic again.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Take into custody for
	questioning,&rdquo; he ordered, though that was standard procedure
	anyway.  As his teams continued their room-by-room search of the
	premises, three more apartments were found to be inhabited, with
	evidence of recent occupation in several more.  Some or all of these
	residents must be the operators.  But as he'd expected, it wasn't
	until they got to the basement level that they hit pay dirt.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Team Four, presence of
	server equipment confirmed in sub-basement. Also one fusion
	generator,&rdquo; the team leader continued after a moment.  Sarner
	smiled in grim satisfaction.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Rip out anything which
	looks like a data store,&rdquo; he ordered.  &ldquo;Slag the rest. 
	Don't worry about shutting it down first.&rdquo;  He sincerely hoped
	a few hundred goddamned illegal shoppers got booted all the way back
	to their jacks.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Teams One and Two had the suspects
	kneeling on the ground in a line in front of the building now. 
	Sarner turned away from his console and slid the door open, jumped
	lightly out of the aircar to the ground.  He walked casually but
	menacingly toward the suspects.  Poor dumb bastards, most of them
	looked groggy and scared, like people startled out of a sound sleep.
	 Having a good time in some virtuality somewhere, and then shazam! 
	Suddenly back in the ol' meatspace body getting the cuffs clipped
	on.  <I>Welcome back to reality, you gutless wire heads</I>.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">One of his team leaders met him in
	front of the line of kneeling geeks, holding out a handful of
	identity cards.   The man nodded at one of the captives, a young guy
	with unkempt hair and a dazed expression, wearing little more than a
	T-shirt and boxer shorts.   &ldquo;That one had a hard-on when we
	unplugged his jack,&rdquo; the team leader reported <I>sotto voce
	</I>with a smirk.  Secretary Sarner chuckled and began scanning the
	ID cards into a palmtop police datapad.  This raid was going great,
	just great.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The IDs of the five people before
	him, no wait there were seven, so at least two of them must not have
	IDs &ndash; well that was something else they could be busted for,
	anyhow &ndash; did not show up as anybody important.   All Americans
	between 20 and 42, three male, two female.  No criminal records, no
	warrants; also no registered assets, no recent job history, and as
	usual no tax file data.  Typical unpatriotic riffraff.  Obviously
	surviving somehow through illegal cyberverse economic activity, but
	nothing to show which ones were connected to the contraband computer
	hardware which even now was being melted down to its constituent
	molecules in the basement.  Though not surviving all that well by
	the look of things, Sarner thought as he looked the bunch of them up
	and down.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Of course you couldn't always
	tell, he reflected.  Some of these people might be rich as lords in
	the cyberverse where they spent nearly all of their conscious hours.
	 Personally he didn't understand what good it was to be rich in a
	world which didn't even exist, when in real life you lived in a
	run-down, half-abandoned shithole like this.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They were out in front of the
	apartment building, in what should have been a lawn, but it was
	mostly gone to weeds and dirt which nobody had bothered to mow or
	water in a long time.  It had been years since the metal siding had
	seen any repairs.  The windows &ndash; which no one had ever
	bothered to replace with self-cleaning glass &ndash; were grimy with
	seasons of blowing dirt and rain, and the paint was peeling off the
	trim.  The nearby street was slowly crumbling into gravel. 
	Everything in the real world was going to hell.  People just didn't
	care anymore.  This was what you got when you turned your back on
	government, which used to make communities sparkle, and made people
	productive and happy, but no longer had the means to do its job.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A burst of anger seized him, as he
	looked this sorry lot of dumbshit cyberpunk anarchists over one more
	time.   &ldquo;Not so smart and gorgeous now, are ya?&rdquo; he said
	to the prisoners at large, with all the well-practiced contempt he
	could put into his voice.  Several heads turned to look up at him. 
	The others looked away, or stared numbly down at the dirt.  &ldquo;We
	don't know which of you was operating that illegal brain house down
	in the basement, so we're going to charge all of you with operating
	an unlicensed business, tax evasion, racketeering, conspiracy, and
	anything else we can think up.  On the other hand, it's likely that
	some of you <I>do</I> know who was responsible.  The ones who rat
	out the criminals will be dealt with leniently.  The ones who don't
	will suffer the same penalties as the guilty parties, just for being
	fucking anarchists who resist legitimate authority.  There won't be
	any cyberverse jacks where you're going.  Oh, and the two of you
	without valid IDs are in deep shit regardless.  I think that about
	covers it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The older woman looked up with a
	frown and dared a protest.  &ldquo;Don't we get an attorney?  Or
	don't citizens have rights anymore?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner was provoked, but kept his
	voice calm to demonstrate his control of himself and the situation. 
	&ldquo;Oh, you're a citizen now, are you?  Haven't paid a cent in
	taxes or given a lick of anything back to your community in probably
	twenty years, but now you want your rights, oh yeah.  Well don't
	worry, you'll get your attorney all right, soon as you get to the
	holding pen in San Fransisco.  A public defender of course, since
	according to your ID file you have absolutely no money, none, zero. 
	Gee, wonder how you pay the rent.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner handed the cluster of IDs
	and the viewer back to his team leader, and looked up to see the
	leader of Team Four emerging from the building.  He gave Sarner a
	high sign and pumped his fist in the air.  Sarner acknowledged the
	destruction of the brain house hardware with a wave conveying well
	done.  He looked once more at the line of kneeling and cuffed
	prisoners, and shook his head sadly.  There was truly nothing more
	to say to this useless scum.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Abruptly he turned on his heel and
	stalked back to his command aircar.  His driver buzzed the door open
	and he boarded.  Now there was nothing remaining but to return to
	headquarters and wait for the team leaders' detail reports to come
	up through channels.  A personal visit to an operation like this was
	always worthwhile to punch up morale and let command demonstrate
	some hands-on interest, and the proper attitude for the rank and
	file.  But somehow he felt incomplete, like there was something he
	could have done or should have done but hadn't.  He didn't know why,
	but the aftermath of raids like this always left him feeling like a
	guy who'd thought he was about to down a scotch and soda, but found
	himself chugging mere ginger ale instead.  Yet the vague feeling of
	dissatisfaction always left him eager for the next raid, pulled him
	ahead, fueled his eagerness, sharpened the spurs of his duty.  And
	that was certainly no bad thing.  He figured he had just about the
	toughest job in the whole world ahead of him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Take off,&rdquo; he ordered
	the driver crisply.  &ldquo;We're returning to headquarters.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes, sir.&rdquo; 
	Immediately they rose, circled the sordid raid site once, and then
	flew off to the northwest, where their aircar vanished into the
	growing afternoon cloud cover.</FONT></DIV>

	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The gavel banged
	on the podium, and the hubbub of voices began to subside. &ldquo;Everyone
	take your seats, please.  Will the Guardian please secure the
	doors.&rdquo;  After a few moments to allow some late entries, the
	door to the large meeting room was firmly closed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">My Lord Chancellor, the
	doors are secured!&rdquo; the man who had closed it said loudly in
	the direction of the podium.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Let the Earl Marshall and
	his aide obtain the passwords from all present, so that we may know
	them to be Knights of our Order.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Two men in Romanesque helmets and
	long red cloaks, carrying wands of office, approached the podium and
	bowed.  The more decorated one, the Earl Marshall, climbed the three
	broad stairs to the dais on which the podium stood before a short
	row of high-backed upholstered wooden chairs.  He approached the
	Lord Chancellor, who stood next to the lectern, gavel in hand, and
	leaned his head close to him.  The Chancellor whispered in his ear
	and gave him an odd handshake followed by a smile and a familiar pat
	on the shoulder.  The Marshall straightened and moved to the next
	man sitting in one of the chairs against the wall behind the
	Chancellor, to the latter's right, and repeated his performance. 
	Simultaneously the Marshall's aide stepped up to begin examining
	those seated behind the Chancellor and to his left.  The two men
	worked their way around the room in opposite directions, beginning
	on the north wall, the Marshall then proceeding north to south along
	the west side with his aide paralleling him down the east side. 
	There was some light, whispered conversation and exchanges of
	various subdued greetings between those seated near each other, as
	the two examiners made their circuit of the room.  This took a
	little time, since there were easily fifty men seated along each
	wall, leaving the center floor area vacant.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The room was large and spacious,
	sumptuously decorated along the lines of a Christian church,
	interspersed with a Roman military theme.  The gilt ceiling high
	above was lit by many crystal chandeliers.  The floor was made of
	flagstones framing a central mosaic design, depicting Jesus whipping
	the money-changers from the temple.  Behind the dais at the north
	end of the room was a vast looming painting, also showing Jesus,
	bearing a sword in one hand and a crown in the other, about to
	invest with both a kneeling knight who had his back to the viewer
	but his face turned up to the radiant glory of the visage of Christ.
	 Clusters of high-backed chairs stood on a raised dais at the north
	and south ends of the room, with a trio of such chairs also in the
	exact center of the longer east and west walls, but at floor level. 
	All of the special chairs, which resembled nothing so much as
	thrones, were occupied by officers decked out in various regalia,
	consisting of helmets, capes, medallions of office, wands, staffs,
	tasseled swords, and the like.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">At length all had been examined in
	the passwords, and the Earl Marshall and his assistant met up in
	front of the south end.  The aide saluted his superior, and then
	both turned to face the officer seated in the center chair at the
	south end.  They bowed, saluted him military style with their wands,
	and then pivoted on their heels and stood at parade rest facing
	north.  The officer they had saluted stood and addressed himself to
	the Chancellor, facing him across the length of the chamber.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Lord Chancellor, your
	officers report that all present are Knights of our Order duly
	entitled to attend these proceedings,&rdquo; he shouted.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Thank you, Vice
	Chancellor,&rdquo; came the response from the opposite end of the
	room.  &ldquo;Will the High Priest please lead us in our opening
	prayer.&rdquo;  The Lord Chancellor banged his gavel on the lectern
	three times, and everyone rose to their feet.  The High Priest rose
	from his station at the center of the east wall and waited a moment
	for quiet.  His regalia plainly resembled that of a bishop, with a
	tall hat like a miter and a crooked staff like a crozier.  He was an
	older man, with bushy grey eyebrows and gnarled hands resting
	lightly on the enormous Bible which was open before him on a stand.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Let us pray,&rdquo; he
	intoned solemnly, and the assembled members dutifully bowed their
	heads.  &ldquo;Our Lord in Heaven, we beseech you to look down with
	favor upon your Servants gathered here to further your purposes upon
	this troubled Earth.  Bless our minds and fill our hearts, so that
	we may hear your call, understand your intent, and find the courage
	always to do your will.  We pledge our lives and our earthly
	fortunes to the sacred Cause of preserving your people in their true
	human nature, yea verily as you did create us in the Beginning. 
	Help us to reject the temptations of the Evil One in these times of
	trial.  Create in us a generous, self-sacrificing spirit that
	forgets not that it must one day return to its Maker and be judged. 
	Inspire us with thy wisdom so that we may not fall to the cunning of
	thine enemies.  Endow us with the strength and conviction to be
	steadfast in our purpose.  Bestow upon us harmony and concord that
	we might serve you unitedly.  And when the strife of this life is
	over, may you welcome us before your Throne, after the example and
	in the glorious Name of your only Son, who taught us to pray&ndash;&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Here the High Priest paused
	momentarily, to give everyone present time to recognize their cue
	and take a breath.  As he continued, the voices of every man present
	conjoined with his.  A low susurrous of male voices &ndash; for
	there were no women present &ndash; caressingly shaped the ancient
	phrases and quietly filled the hall.  &ldquo;Our Father, who art in
	Heaven, hallowed be thy Name.  Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done,
	on Earth as it is in Heaven.  Give us this day our daily bread, and
	forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against
	us.  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.  For
	thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory forever.  Amen.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The assembled members raised their
	heads, and looked expectantly up to the Chancellor at his podium. 
	&ldquo;The members will give the sign of our Order,&rdquo; he
	commanded.  In unison, everyone present briefly pressed the first
	three fingers of their right hand horizontally across their
	forehead, then across their lips, and finally across their heart. 
	The Chancellor answered them with the same motions, then raised his
	arms in the air and exclaimed: &ldquo;Hail to the Covenant of
	Christ!&rdquo;  The members standing along the south wall, led by
	the Vice Chancellor, cried out the same words, echoed by those
	standing along the west wall, and last by those on the east side.  
	When the final cry had died away, the Chancellor continued: &ldquo;Right
	Supporter, perform the duty of your station.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The man standing at the right hand
	of the Lord Chancellor's empty chair called out: &ldquo;I hereby
	proclaim this Lodge of the Knights of Jesus open in the first degree
	for the transaction of lawful business.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Officers and knights, so be
	it,&rdquo; the Chancellor intoned.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So be it,&rdquo; echoed the
	assembly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Guardian, you are now
	permitted to admit those outside who are in possession of the
	passwords, and allow those present to depart.  The Lodge may be
	seated.&rdquo;  He banged the gavel a single time, and the assembled
	members sank into their plush seats.  After the rustling and
	murmured conversation subsided, the Lord Chancellor looked over his
	shoulder at a man seated behind him on the north wall, and receiving
	a faint nod in response, turned back to the hall and spoke again.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Since we have a very
	special visitor tonight, I'd like to suspend our normal order of
	business so that he can address us all on a subject of paramount
	importance.  I refer, of course, to the Reverend Maxwell Cleary.  As
	you all know, Reverend Cleary was a founding member of our Order,
	and is a three-time Past Vicar-General.   Since neither he nor his
	topic tonight require any further introduction, I shall without
	further ado yield him the floor.  My brother knights, I give you Sir
	Maxwell Cleary.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reverend Cleary rose from his
	seat, stepped forward, and shook the hand of the Lodge's Chancellor,
	to the eruption of enthusiastic applause.  The Chancellor assumed
	his throne-like chair in the back, while Cleary proceeded to the
	podium, where he held up his arms and waggled his hands for silence.
	 This was not immediately forthcoming, as the gathered knights
	continued to cheer him despite his gesture.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Reverend Cleary was a man of
	unprepossessing height and average build, with dark, curly, auburn
	hair worn short and beginning to go grey around his temples.  He
	appeared to be in his middle fifties.  His dark suit was
	conservatively elegant without being pretentious, his tie loosened
	slightly around his collar to convey a certain casual deportment. 
	His face was not particularly remarkable, though well-defined with
	strong, masculine lines, except for the unusual fact that he wore
	glasses.  This was not a mere affectation on his part.  His vision
	in fact required a modest correction, and his refusal, on grounds of
	principle, to allow his eyes themselves to be altered from how God
	had made them was an integral part of his legend.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary acquiesced to the ongoing
	ovation with a what-can-I-do shrug and a kindly smile behind
	twinkling blue eyes.  He stepped away from the lectern and made a
	casual but respectful bow.  The applause increased in intensity,
	then at last began to subside as he stepped back behind the podium
	and again motioned for quiet.  Finally, complete silence fell.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The peace of Christ be with
	you!  My brethren, I thank you most sincerely for that overwhelming
	reception.  Like all of you, I too sometimes become distressed and
	discouraged at the pervasive strength of the evil and folly that
	sweep the world in these woeful latter days which we all share.  But
	whenever I come back to a KOJ lodge to speak, it is truly like
	coming home.  And when I behold your enthusiasm and commitment for
	our great Work, it refreshes my strength and fills me with renewed
	hope.   I thank you all for the great gift of your support and
	appreciation, because it reminds me that no matter how bleak our
	outward circumstances may become, united as Brothers in Christ we
	can triumph over even the greatest adversity.&rdquo;  Cleary paused
	for breath and a smattering of further applause.  His voice was
	smooth and practiced, its tone a little weary but expressive of
	great resilience and unshakable conviction.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">My friends, you know that
	the Singularian folly by which the Devil has bewitched so many of
	our fellowmen has been growing in power and in menace.  But this of
	course is nothing new.  So while we would be wrong not to be
	outraged by recent turns of events, we must also take care to view
	these latest developments in their proper context and proportion.  
	What our response should be to these latest absurdities and
	blasphemies is what we must decide.  Yet I tell you now that I
	believe that they may yet provide us with a truly exciting
	opportunity.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But before discussing that
	opportunity further, I think it were only proper to review the
	history leading up to these events.  For millennia, Man has striven
	with the brain which God gave him to master his world and improve
	the sophistication of his arts, to the betterment of himself and of
	his world.   In the beginning, this alleviated much suffering and
	greatly improved the lot of Man.  Inventions such as fire,
	agriculture, metal tools, building and weaving techniques, and
	medicine, unquestionably made life better for all.  In those days
	the figure of Prometheus &ndash; who gave fire to Man &ndash; was a
	friendly figure, who helped human civilization to advance.  So too
	Athena, the ancient goddess of wisdom and artifice, or what we would
	in modern times call technology.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yet there is, sadly,
	another side to the unleashing of human innovation.  Prometheus is
	also a personification of the Devil, and he was horribly punished by
	the gods for setting mankind upon the path of technological
	development.  Even in ancient times, great thinkers wondered where
	the drive for discovery and invention coupled with human arrogance
	might someday lead the human race.  Saint Augustine warned that that
	which improves the earthly lot of Man also tempts him to turn away
	from God.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In the ages which followed,
	the fears of those early religious thinkers indeed came to pass.  
	It became commonly believed that life on this mortal Earth was
	actually more important than the eternal afterlife which all those
	who believe in their salvation will spend with God.  Men decided
	that the intelligence which God had given them should be used
	without limit or restraint, and moreover that it was actually the
	key to understanding the mind of the Creator, through the scientific
	study of His Creation.  The life of the mind became preeminent over
	the life of the spirit.  The doublespeak of twisted historical
	interpretation has given these eras names like the Renaissance, the
	Reformation, and the Enlightenment.  But in reality they were the
	centuries in which the darkness began to fall.  The primacy of
	religion was questioned; churches fragmented and fell into factions;
	men made a new religion of earthly pleasures and riches; rulers
	divinely anointed to lead the people on the paths of righteousness
	were toppled, and replaced with rulers elected because they promised
	the people an endless increase in their worldly estates.  The Ten
	Commandments were shattered and the golden calf was raised on high!</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">At last, in the century
	just past, the arrogance and folly of Man and his technology were
	raised to heights undreamed of by the earlier humanist philosophers.
	 Man's technology became at length so powerful that men not only
	turned away from God, they aimed even to usurp the place of God. 
	Nuclear energy gave mankind the power to destroy as only God can
	destroy.  The abomination of genetic engineering gave men the power
	to tamper with the basic structure of life itself, daring to
	&ldquo;improve&rdquo; upon God's own handiwork, and even to design
	entire blasphemous new species.   Nanomedicine allowed men to heal
	as only Jesus could heal, and finally to withhold mortality itself
	from Man, who is thus deluded that his earthly life need never end.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Worst of all, computing
	technology provided the ability to imitate the mind of Man itself,
	first by extending its reach and ultimately by duplicating its
	entire function.  Thus the Devil has at last recreated Man in his
	own image: a machine, having intelligence but no soul, a clever mind
	but no spirit.   A body which did not come from God and will not
	return to Him, but is cut off from the light of heaven, forever. 
	The dis-transfiguration of Man is now complete: he is no longer from
	God, belonging to God, and a mere temporary resident of this world. 
	Now he is of the world, a creation of his own artifice, serving only
	himself, owned not by God but by the Adversary.  He is apart from
	God.  Perhaps he deems that he is God.  But in the end he is
	nothing.  He has played away the truth of himself, sacrificed all
	that which made him what he was.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">My friends, it is in this
	stark context that we must view the latest developments in order to
	comprehend fully the depths of their depravity!  We are told that a
	great Scanner glances backward in time and copies the body and brain
	of a person shortly before their death.  This copy is then fed into
	a computer core where it runs as a program.  And we are then told,
	with a straight face, that this procedure has somehow brought the
	dead back to life!</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Oh Man, how fallen you have
	become in the depths of your arrogance!  How can ye not see the
	terrible absurdity of your false resurrection?  We are told that the
	copy is the real man, because the scan was made before he died.  You
	see how the Devil acknowledges the truth of the soul, but twists it.
	 For how can a soul be copied by a scanning machine?  And what could
	possibly prevent that soul from going home to God when the body
	dies, whether the body was ever scanned or not?  The &ldquo;resurrected&rdquo;
	copy is a mere simulacrum of a man; but it is not a man.  It may be
	an accurate reflection of the man, having his knowledge, his
	memories, his skills, even his personality.  But if it has not his
	spirit, how can it be the man himself?  By necessity, it is a man
	without a soul, a mere machine and not a human being. </FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We are
	told that this is analogous to those who willingly gave up their
	biological bodies altogether in order to exist on &ldquo;higher
	substrates.&rdquo;  If they are alive, the argument goes, then so
	too are these deceased ones who were scanned and copied.  And thus
	the Devil lies with the truth, for even as these scanned beings are
	not alive, and are not human, so too those who have given up their
	bodies are no longer human, and likewise have no true life.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary paused in his oration,
	knowing full well from the rapt silence that he had his audience
	enthralled.  Had he been a mountebank, he would have smiled to
	himself.  But he was not.  Reverend Cleary was perfectly sincere. </FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">By rights
	the world should respond to this announcement with a torrent of
	laughter that would shake the globe to its foundations,&rdquo; he
	continued.  &ldquo;But alas, it is a measure of how far the Devil's
	influence has now spread that many throughout the world are taking
	it all too seriously.  As always, the temptation which the Devil
	offers is sweet and compelling: to be reunited with those whom you
	have lost, without having to wait for your own passage through
	death.  To gain the chance to know your own ancestors, or great
	figures of the past.  But it is all a lie, and a distraction meant
	to keep you from what is truly important: to know God, and to be
	reunited with Him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">My fear is that this
	travesty opens the final act in the great drama of human history. 
	The Devil commences playing his end game.  If this folly is not
	checked, it may lead, over time, to a false copy being made of every
	single human being who has ever lived, and died.  And they will live
	together, not in the paradise of the next world, but in simulated
	paradises contained within this world.  And so a false resurrection
	will be substituted for the true resurrection, a virtual heaven for
	the spiritual heaven, and an indefinite earthly life for eternal
	life.  There is a reason why the Evil One's minions in this world
	have named this final, ultimate act of human usurpation &ldquo;The
	Last Trumpet Project.&rdquo;  There is a reason why they dare to
	style the virtual environments in which their scanned simulacrums
	will reside as &rdquo;the mansions of the dead.&rdquo;  That they
	steal the very terminology of Scripture is proof, if any more were
	needed, that this is the final and ultimate blasphemy, in which the
	Devil's Technology attempts to supplant God's Theology, whole and
	entire.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In the end, my brothers in
	Christ, it will come down to faith, as it always does: if you have
	faith in the Resurrection of the Living Christ, then you will not
	seek to preserve your body or your consciousness forever in this
	world.  You will trust in the promise of the New Testament, you will
	die, you will be redeemed, and return to God whence you came.  But
	if you falter in your faith, if your courage fails, then you will
	waver and accept the Devil's bargain, and exchange your immortality
	for the false coin of earthly continuance.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It is with deep regret that
	I inform you that untold millions of our fellowmen around the world
	are lining up to do exactly this.  As prophesy warns us, few are
	those who cling to the straight path of faith in the Last Days.  But
	for those of us who do cling to that path, it falls to us to make it
	clear to as many as possible, as well as we can, just what is truly
	at stake: nothing less than the very soul of the human race.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Again Cleary paused, to scan the
	faces of the men around the room looking up at him, waiting for him
	to offer them hope, a plan, some course of action whereby they could
	make a difference.  He had one.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">My fellow Knights of Jesus,
	a great Work is beginning.  For behold God has moved the hearts of
	some of those who call themselves Sings, and whose earthly bodies
	are polluted with the filth of nanotechnology and computer
	technology, and caused them to repent and ally themselves with our
	cause.  Even now they are helping us to track down the very brain
	houses where these atrocities are taking place.  For it is the
	Devil's great weakness that everything in the false world of virtual
	reality must yet be tied to a physical place in the real world.  We
	will discover those places and we will destroy them!</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Our Lord has also spoken to
	the hearts of some of those who fill important posts in government. 
	And I tell you that they too are making common cause with us!  For
	many centuries, the state has been godless, secular, serving the
	cause of Evil.  Humanist philosophers strove to find a basis for the
	state derived from political or economic theories, based on
	democracy, or utilitarian social values.  And in the end those in
	government who thought to ground the state in this world and its
	concerns received their just reward:  technology overtook their
	function, made them irrelevant, and swept them impotently aside. 
	Their error lay in attempting to root political authority within
	this world, rather than in the next.  To derive power and legitimacy
	from Man rather than from God.  Behold, it is now Our Father's
	purpose that our government officials repent of their past follies
	and join with us in our struggle.  The Apostle Peter spake to Jesus
	saying: 'Here are two swords,' and Jesus answered: 'It is enough.' 
	Church and State are the twin swords, and verily Jehovah is
	reforging them both to be wielded in our cause!</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">With this union
	accomplished, our hope brightens.  We can lay waste to the computing
	hardware where these blasphemies are being perpetrated, and in a
	coordinated, simultaneous fashion all around the world.  Even now,
	the list of targets and the strike teams are being prepared.  And
	when the multitudes perceive that the faithful of God's Church and
	the remnants of the world's fallen governments are working together
	to combat this evil, their complacency will be shaken and the
	Devil's hold over many shall be loosed.  Behold how the Lord
	stretches out his hand to aid his faithful even as the Adversary's
	victory looms nearer!  How else could so many hearts change so much,
	and at such a critical moment?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">My brother knights, I tell
	you this now so that you will understand that the moment is coming
	which you have long awaited.  The Order will shortly call upon you
	to render that ultimate service which you offered when you joined
	yourself to its membership.  Your marching orders are on their way. 
	It is time to march to holy war as Christian soldiers have always
	marched when Called.  I am proud to march beside you.  I am honored
	to fight with you.  And with God's help we will be victorious!  We
	shall save many souls in the months ahead.  The Devil may have this
	world within his grip, but he shall not have the faithful!  He shall
	not have those who repent!  He will not take those who are willing
	to live and die as the example of Christ instructed us!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary abruptly lowered his voice
	back to conversational levels.  &ldquo;My friends, I believe the
	final battle with Evil is about to be joined.  May God bless and
	keep us all.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As Reverend Cleary fell silent,
	the assembled knights rose to their feet in a spontaneous,
	thunderous ovation.  They cheered, they raised their fists high in
	the air.  Some whistled, some wept silently even as they applauded. 
	The Lodge's Chancellor approached Cleary and embraced him, as if on
	behalf of everyone present.  With a final wave to the assembled
	brothers, Reverend Cleary returned to his seat and the Lord
	Chancellor banged the gavel once to restore order.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Continuing with the day's
	regular business,&rdquo; he said as everyone became seated and quiet
	once more.  &ldquo;Mr. Secretary, are there any new member
	applications before us this evening?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A tall man seated behind a desk on
	the floor to the Chancellor's right rose to answer.  &ldquo;There
	are none upon which a ballot must be taken tonight, sir.  But there
	are four new applications which have been received, for the
	following applicants: Timothy Sparing, Brigham Smyth, Joshua Arrens,
	and Louis Mellingham.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Then let the examining
	committee interview the applicants at their convenience, and report
	their findings to the Lodge at our next regularly scheduled
	meeting.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It will be done, my Lord
	Chancellor,&rdquo; the Secretary promised, and was seated.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We will now hear the
	reports of our standing committees,&rdquo; the Chancellor announced.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reverend Cleary sat back in his
	plush seat and let the ongoing meeting blur out of his mind's focus.
	 Now that his speech was finished, he was remembering how tired he
	was, and how worried.  Things weren't really likely to go as
	swimmingly as his speech suggested.  It was essential that he
	inspire and motivate others, yet these days he found himself praying
	for strength and faith, and wondering who was going to inspire him
	in turn.  There was such a very long way to go, and he was already
	weary.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay, Salma,
	Cylara, and Torch found themselves standing in the lobby of a posh
	hotel.   The ceiling soared many floors above them, with railings
	overhung with potted vines ringing the atrium over their heads,
	marking where each floor opened onto the hotel's hollow central
	core.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A hotel simulation?&rdquo;
	Cylara said, her voice slightly acid with disappointment.  &ldquo;Well
	that's kind of a let-down.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yeah,&rdquo; Clay was
	forced to agree.  &ldquo;And it's not even open, by the looks of
	things.&rdquo;  Looking around, they saw that he was right.  None of
	the desks or counters were staffed, there were no guests sitting
	anywhere in the lobby, and the lights were dimmed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well the point of a
	simulation for the dead would be to make them feel comfortable, not
	throw them into some exotic environment right away,&rdquo; Torch
	commented equably.  He didn't seem much put out by the ordinary
	surroundings, and was looking around with interest.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He's right,&rdquo; Salma
	agreed.  &ldquo;Let's take a peek at what's outside the building.&rdquo;
	 She abruptly started walking toward what appeared to be the street
	exit, a set of brass revolving doors.  The others followed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay noticed a flashing indicator
	on his heads-up visual interface display.  One tiny corner of his
	vision had ceased to be transparent and was blinking to attract his
	attention.  When he glanced directly at it the flashing indicator
	vanished and was replaced by some text: &ldquo;Recommend clothing
	style reconfiguration.&rdquo;  Well, naturally.  They were still
	dressed for the zero-G nightclub, and by the looks of this place
	they were now in a simulation somewhere in the past.  As soon as he
	thought this, the interface offered him a short menu of choices:
	&ldquo;Cool/Hip, Powerful/Wealthy, Common/Inconspicuous,
	Exotic/Unusual, Shady/Disreputable.&rdquo;  With a quick flick of
	his eyes he elected to blend in with the crowd.  Instantly his
	clothes altered to a pullover shirt and denim pants.  The others did
	likewise by the time they reached the hotel doors.  Salma was now
	wearing casual slacks and Cylara a medium length skirt and blouse.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There were some virtualities where
	the visitor could likewise control their own individual perception
	of the appearance of others' avatars, but this was very much the
	exception.  The ability to control one's own appearance and rely on
	the fact that other people saw you as you wished to appear, was so
	fundamental to self-expression that by common consent most worlds
	vested control of avatar appearance solely with the avatar's owner.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The revolving doors proved to be
	locked, but there were doors on either hand with push bars behind
	them which would open them, even though locked from the outside. 
	They had no sooner opened these then a voice called from behind
	them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">May I help you?&rdquo;  The
	four spun to locate the source of the voice.  About ten paces behind
	them stood a nicely dressed man in a dark suit, perhaps a hotel
	manager.  &ldquo;I'm afraid we're closed for renovations.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Right, sorry to bother
	you,&rdquo; Torch replied.  &ldquo;We just wandered in by mistake.&rdquo;
	 They made their exit onto the street outside before any further
	conversation could take place with this personage.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">AI guard?&rdquo; Clay
	wondered.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Maybe, who knows?&rdquo;
	Torch replied.  &ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They stood on the sidewalk
	fronting a busy street, full of automobile traffic.  It was a warm,
	late summer afternoon.  A few fair-weather clouds peeked around the
	edges of the tall buildings which formed a steel and concrete canyon
	around them.  The people hurrying past on the sidewalk spared them
	scarcely a sidelong glance as they emerged from the closed hotel. 
	Instinctively they picked a direction and began walking briskly down
	the block.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">When they reached the corner, Clay
	paused by a newspaper machine and nodded at it.  Its window
	displayed a copy of the <I>New York Times</I>, and the leading
	headline concerned an upcoming presidential campaign debate.  Clay
	scanned it for a moment or two, then turned left and began walking
	down the next block.  The others stayed close.  &ldquo;Vice
	President Bush and Governor Dukakis.  That means we're in New York
	in what, 1988?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes,&rdquo; Salma
	concurred.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Would that be George the
	Second or George the Third then?&rdquo; Cylara asked almost
	absently, as she looked at the city around them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Second,&rdquo; Salma
	answered.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Don't gawk around like
	that, Cy,&rdquo; Clay warned.  &ldquo;People will think you're a
	tourist and it'll cause us trouble.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We are tourists,&rdquo; she
	laughed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No,&rdquo; Torch said a bit
	brusquely.  &ldquo;We're trying to find out what's going on here.&rdquo;
	 Keeping their heads down and stalking along purposefully in silence
	like the natives, they meandered another couple of blocks from the
	hotel.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This is quite the
	simulation,&rdquo; Clay offered after a few minutes.  &ldquo;People,
	buildings inside and out, all the period details.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yeah,&rdquo; Torch agreed. 
	&ldquo;Wonder if the whole city is simulated?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That would mean there were
	what, ten million NPCs here?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Something like that.  Look,
	there's a park.&rdquo;  In the next block they could see a small
	park with trees and fountains and some benches in the shade.  There
	was also a hot dog vendor with his cart parked at the corner.  Clay
	ambled toward him purposefully.  &ldquo;Let's get a bite and sit
	over there on that bench and talk.&rdquo;  By the time he reached
	the hot dog stand he had reconfigured his attire to include a
	leather wallet in his back pocket, supplied with local currency in
	various denominations.  The hot dog seller interacted with them
	quite nonchalantly, making them their food as they requested,
	offering them drinks, giving Clay his change.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They sat together at two benches
	set with an acute angle between them, in the vertex of a raised,
	wood-framed berm with shrub evergreens planted inside it.  They had
	for the moment a little privacy around them as they savored the
	flavors of their food and the warm afternoon sun, which gleamed over
	the length of a long, traffic-choked street running west.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Very convincing
	simulation,&rdquo; Torch opined.  &ldquo;But what's the purpose? 
	Fooling dead New Yorkers into thinking they're still alive?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Acclimation?&rdquo; Salma
	suggested.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Maybe they gradually
	replace the NPCs with the real people they were simulating as they
	bring the actual ones through the Scanner,&rdquo; Cylara offered.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That's a thought,&rdquo;
	Clay said around a big mouthful of hot dog and sauerkraut.  &ldquo;I
	think all of these are NPCs though.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I wonder if they all start
	out at the hotel?&rdquo; Torch asked as he set down his soda.  &ldquo;It
	wasn't open.  Maybe there are no Last Trumpet folks here yet.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I would guess that the
	hotel is a processing and orientation center,&rdquo; said Salma. 
	&ldquo;So you're probably right.  This simulation isn't in use yet.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So why is it running?  Or
	did it all boot up when we zoned in here?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma shrugged.  &ldquo;If it did,
	someone or something will notice that it's running now.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Uh-oh,&rdquo; Clay said in
	a low voice.  &ldquo;Speak of the devil.&rdquo;  He nodded toward a
	man approaching them.  It was the same darkly elegant dude they had
	glimpsed in the hotel lobby.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He stopped a few paces in front of
	them and smiled reassuringly.  His hand opened at his side and
	suddenly it was holding a folding chair, already opened, which he
	placed on the ground.  He sat facing them and looked at each of them
	in turn.  This being was obviously no ordinary NPC, to break the
	rules of the simulation so casually.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You do not belong here,&rdquo;
	he said pleasantly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Um, who are you?&rdquo;
	Clay asked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The man smiled again.  &ldquo;I am
	the Custodian.  Why have you come to this virtual space?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Just looking,&rdquo; Torch
	said, matching his calm and easy tone.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You're the superuser AI?&rdquo;
	Clay asked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Custodian nodded politely in
	acknowledgment.  &ldquo;And you are all living projections.  You are
	contemporary.  You are not our intended client&egrave;le.  Why are
	you here?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Like I said, we were
	curious about this virtuality, so we came to check it out,&rdquo;
	Torch elaborated.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You did not know then, what
	you expected to find?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That's correct,&rdquo;
	Salma responded.  The Custodian appeared to consider.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yet you can only have come
	here by using an unique cryptokey disc, which if I am not very much
	mistaken is presently in your pants pocket, Mr. Torch.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch looked confused for a brief
	moment.  &ldquo;Yes, well of course.  That's what we wanted to check
	out, where the disc went.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And so I would like to know
	where you obtained it,&rdquo; the Custodian said evenly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Um, from a friend.&rdquo; 
	Torch's three companions looked closely at him at this point, since
	he had never really satisfied their curiosity on this particular
	point, either.  The Custodian blinked and gave him a measuring look.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A check of the available
	access logs for cyberverse virtualities in which your private key
	fingerprint appears, correlated with those of your associates with
	whom you have entered those virtualities in the past three months,
	strongly suggests that you do not have any friends who would have
	had legitimate access to a copy of the cryptokey that you now
	possess.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">All four of them stared drop-jawed
	at the Custodian.  It was practically axiomatic that supervisory AIs
	in a given virtuality did not have access to information or data
	stores outside the particular cyberverse location for which they
	were responsible.  It was also well settled that tracing a
	particular person's key fingerprints across very many cyberverse

	were run by independent hosting companies which did not share
	customer data with one another.  Packet routing traces were
	infeasible.  What kind of mesh spyware system could this AI possibly
	be tapping into?  Or was it merely bluffing?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I don't see how you could
	be in a position to know that, sir,&rdquo; Torch replied levelly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Custodian smiled, not
	unkindly.  &ldquo;All of virtual reality exists in the form of data
	patterns, just as all of physical reality exists in patterns of what
	are called matter and energy.  If you can perceive the pattern of
	the whole, you can also spot the pieces of it that do not fit
	properly.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This of course was borderline
	preposterous.  &ldquo;And you are able to do this, Custodian?&rdquo;
	Clay asked seriously.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No smile this time.  &ldquo;Not
	I.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I got the disc from a
	friend,&rdquo; Torch said, betraying impatience for the first time. 
	&ldquo;He said it had something to do with the mansions for the Last
	Trumpet Project.  It bears the seal of the High Sings.  And from
	what you've been saying, I'd have to guess my friend was right.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Custodian nodded pleasantly. 
	&ldquo;Mr. Torch, did you receive this cryptokey in real reality,
	and upload it through your cyberverse interface?&rdquo;  Abruptly,
	the Custodian was holding the coin-like disc from Torch's pocket
	between the fingers of his right hand.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No.&rdquo; </FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Custodian
	studied Torch for a moment longer, then slipped the disc into his
	breast pocket.  Cylara was also looking at Torch sidelong.  &ldquo;Very
	well.  Your time here is at an end.  To where would you like me to
	zone you?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Uh, how about back to the
	Mall?&rdquo; Salma suggested, after a moment of shock at this abrupt
	dismissal.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Custodian made a small seated
	bow.  &ldquo;As you wish, then.  Goodbye.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Without further preamble, New York
	faded to grey, and then the Mall of the Western Hemisphere
	reappeared around them.   They were standing in the very spot in
	which they had appeared when they'd left the nightclub.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Do you believe that guy?&rdquo;
	Clay exclaimed.  &ldquo;I've never seen a supervisor AI like that.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Me neither,&rdquo; Torch
	agreed.  &ldquo;Bit of an attitude, though I suppose we <I>were</I>
	trespassing.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Dude, he actually implied
	that he knew everywhere you'd been in the past three months and
	everyone you'd been there with.  That is flat out impossible, even
	for the Full Sings.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara was looking around them,
	her face white.  &ldquo;I wouldn't be so sure of that.  Guys, look
	where we are.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They looked around, got the point.
	 &ldquo;How the hell did he do that?&rdquo; Torch demanded, sounding
	almost angry now.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I don't know,&rdquo; Salma
	said softly.  &ldquo;There must be like a million zone points into
	this Mall.  And this isn't where we were when we zoned into his
	cyberverse location, either, so he didn't just reverse our last
	zone.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That's fucking creepy,&rdquo;
	Clay concluded.  &ldquo;I don't like it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Me neither,&rdquo; said
	Torch.  Then after a moment, he continued: &ldquo;You guys get all
	that about seeing the pattern of the whole world and spotting what
	was out of place?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Techno-mystic mumbo-jumbo,&rdquo;
	Clay said dismissively.  &ldquo;Nobody can see the data pattern of
	the whole cyberverse.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yeah, but why program a
	custodial AI to spout prattle like that?&rdquo; Salma wondered.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara giggled suddenly.  &ldquo;Maybe
	so the resurrected ones that they send there will feel at home.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay rolled his eyes.  &ldquo;Well
	speaking of home, time to head there I think.  I've had enough
	adventure for one day.  You coming, Salma, or do you have some
	shopping you want to do?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma shook her head.  She walked
	up next to him and kissed him on the ear.  &ldquo;Nope, I'll come
	home with you I think.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara brightened and turned to
	her boyfriend.  &ldquo;How about you?  You still ready to light my
	fire, Torchy?&rdquo;  He laughed and put his arm around her.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yeah, 'course.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Be seein' ya then, guys,&rdquo;
	Clay said as he and Salma turned and walked away holding hands. 
	Torch and Cylara did the same, waving cheerfully as they headed off
	in a different direction.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A quintillion data packets surged
	through the geographically distributed yet interlinked digital

	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin zoned
	directly into the familiar office and simply stood looking around
	for a moment.  Office was not really a good word for it, he decided.
	 Laboratory also did not really suit, though it could be considered
	that, too.  It was a single round chamber with marble floors, with a
	diameter of perhaps fifty feet.  At three equilateral points along
	the outer circumference were large oval doorways, at least a dozen
	feet wide, that opened onto an expansive deck, which Justin knew
	made a greater ring around the building.  A breeze was flowing
	through one of these openings, warm and damp.  Outside he could see
	rain-lashed grey skies, of late afternoon darkening towards evening,
	and distant flashes of lightning.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Inside the room there were several
	groupings of comfortable furniture: padded chairs, tables, couches,
	rugs, floor lamps, holographic data consoles.  A woman sat at a vast
	wooden desk with her back to him.  Before her were a number of
	holo-screens and what looked like a 3D simulation of some type of
	molecular circuit, on which she was concentrating.  Her dark, glossy
	hair hung just below her shoulders.  Justin said nothing, but
	stepped forward casually to stand beside her chair on her right.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Hello Justin,&rdquo; she
	said as he came to a stop, but she did not look up.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana.&rdquo;  Justin
	focused his attention on the simulation presented in the central
	holo-screen before him.   As he assimilated the data and what it
	represented, his eyebrows twitched upward.  &ldquo;Whoa.  Does that
	work?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana glanced up at him
	sidelong.  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said with a light, musical laugh. 
	She gave some of the equations written on a holo-datapad in front of
	her a rather stern look, and they rewrote themselves with
	modifications.   The simulation swirled as it reset, then progressed
	forward, now being governed by the revised equations.  The molecular
	circuit performed a computation involving transitions between
	electron states and particle spins.  What looked like glowing sparks
	irrupted from the simulated molecules and jetted outside the edge of
	the simulation.  These, Justin knew, represented quantum state
	events being sent to other particles of matter which were entangled
	with the ones in the simulation.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You've almost got the
	patterning correct,&rdquo; Justin said, sounding a little bit awed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes,&rdquo; she answered
	matter-of-factly.  &ldquo;It was obvious we'd need to use transverse
	energy waves to pattern the base matter and align it.  The problem
	is with the entangled particles.  There's a possible reverse quantum
	effect that causes perturbations in the circuit matter.  This
	creates a feedback loop which destabilizes the circuit.  To
	eliminate it, we would either have to isolate the entangled matter
	within an energetic null zone, or co-locate it near the circuit
	itself.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And since the
	decentralization and wide distribution of the network is a primary
	design goal&ndash;&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Doing either defeats the
	purpose of the experiment,&rdquo; she concluded with a nod.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So what approach are you
	taking?&rdquo; Justin asked, becoming slightly more animated as he
	focused on the problem at hand.  &ldquo;I see you're playing with
	damping functions.  Do you think you can create an oscillator that&ndash;&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No,&rdquo; she said cutting
	off his question with a slight head-shake.  &ldquo;Not with a
	reactive, deterministic function.  What's needed is a predictive
	damper that can compensate proactively rather than reactively.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin considered this. 
	&ldquo;Probabilistic, or purely algorithmic?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana sighed.  &ldquo;I would
	hope for an algorithmic solution within the constraints of events
	inside the limited reference frame.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin gestured toward a padded
	office chair some meters away and it vanished and reappeared in his
	hand as he sat down in it.   He shook his head.  &ldquo;With that
	kind of a problem in chaos theory, you could end up with an
	algorithm requiring way more computing power than the circuits it's
	facilitating could supply.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana turned and looked at him
	directly for the first time, her dark black eyes somehow aglow in
	the soft but angular planes of her lovely Asian face.  Her
	expression was warm but serious.  &ldquo;I doubt it, Justin,&rdquo;
	she said softly but resolutely.  &ldquo;There <I>is</I> a solution,
	a quantum formula that governs all of this.  None of these events we
	call probabilistic are really random, we know that.  There is an
	underlying mathematical reality that incorporates it all.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">God does not play with
	dice,&rdquo; Justin quoted.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana laughed.  &ldquo;God is
	not a relevant concept.  It is we who cannot afford to play with
	dice.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He smiled.  &ldquo;And I suppose
	you need me working on the combinatorics of the perturbations in the
	quantum networking protocol.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You suppose correctly, my
	dear.  You spend too much time with the Moshes.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Because I don't want to
	have to clean up the mess they're likely to make if they keep on
	with what they're doing.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin, when we can harness
	the computing power of the matter of this planet, it won't matter
	what the Moshes are doing.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You sometimes focus on the
	big picture a little too much, my love.   There are many innocents
	at risk here.  They are vulnerable even if we are not, and they are
	entitled to our concern.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana smiled at him fondly. 
	&ldquo;You are a truly moral man.  I think I'm ready for a short
	break.  Care for a walk in the rain?&rdquo;  She stood up and held
	out her hand, which he took.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They walked together out onto the
	balcony that encircled the building.  Riksana's aerie was built on
	the pinnacle of a graceful steel spire which stood improbably out of
	the sea a good half a mile high.   It was the only piece of land in
	sight; as far as Justin knew, the only bit of land designed into
	this virtual world.  The grey-green sea below churned against the
	base of the spire, which stood in shallow water on a sea mount which
	did not quite reach to the surface.  Clouds, rain, gentle breeze,
	distant rays of the setting sun filtering through the haze to the
	ocean below.  Everything was air and sea, with <I>terra firma</I>
	reduced to the faintest brush strokes on the grand canvas
	surrounding it.  Everything was comfortable but functional and
	plain, with elegantly understated decoration where any was present
	at all.  An Escher-like spiral design ringed the edge of the
	balcony, but there was no railing, only a curve thrust against the
	tangent of the empty air; and nearly a kilometer below that, the sea
	rippling with wind-driven waves.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was in fact raining very little
	at the moment, only a few warm sprinkles hitting their faces as they
	faced upwind to look out at the vista.   As usual when they were
	together, their minds moved into a light rapport, sharing surface
	thoughts, sense impressions, and feelings.  There was no need to
	discuss the view, or the various atmospheric phenomena, or the
	responses that these stimulated in either of them.   Being together
	in this place, which for them meant thinking and feeling together,
	was more intimate than any audible conversation or physical gesture.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So tell me, how is Stefan's
	Project coming along?&rdquo; Riksana asked, as they watched a
	slanting sunbeam pierce through the clouds near the horizon.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The last trumpet has now
	been sounded for more than a thousand souls,&rdquo; Justin replied
	somewhat impishly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana rolled her eyes.  &ldquo;It's
	not my mythic tradition, but I can't help but think that's a
	terrible metaphor for what the Cronus Scan actually does.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">True.  It's very Mosh. 
	They themselves adopt it as a descriptive metaphor, and then decide
	that it offends them.  Not very sensible.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But then, their entire
	religion isn't very sensible,&rdquo; said Riksana steadily.  &ldquo;It
	boils down to God sacrificing his only son, to himself, to appease
	his own wrath at the sins of his people, whom of course he created
	as sinners to begin with.  I mean, even if you're in need of
	something to worship, who needs a god like that?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin opened his mouth to attempt
	a straight answer, then broke out laughing instead.  &ldquo;I should
	introduce you to Reverend Cleary,&rdquo; he said with a final
	chuckle.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A man whose intellectual
	powers are so weak that he can't escape the grip of the meme viruses
	which have programmed his neuro-cortex for him?  No thanks.&rdquo; 
	Riksana had always taken a dim view, almost contemptuous, of purely
	biological intelligence.  And she had a point.  How indeed do you
	convince someone whose very brain cells have been stamped and shaped
	by a belief system, to the point where anything out of harmony with
	his world view is automatically filtered out and cannot even truly
	register in his consciousness?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But Justin's suggestion had not of
	course been serious.  Catching a flash of Riksana's deeper thoughts,
	he experienced a frisson of an immense matrix of second order
	partial differential equations.  He turned to face her and smiled at
	her slowly.  &ldquo;I have the distinct impression, my dear, that
	this conversation does not have your full attention.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She looked up into his face and
	smiled back.  &ldquo;Dear Justin, you have at this moment 3.65% of
	my total attention.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He feigned astonishment.  &ldquo;As
	much as that?&rdquo;  And he leaned in to kiss her on the lips.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She became abruptly pliant in his
	arms and lingered over the kiss.  As they drew apart, she murmured,
	&ldquo;Four percent.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He feigned exasperation.  &ldquo;You're
	impossible!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No, this quantum networking
	problem is impossible.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Serious again, Justin shook his
	head.  &ldquo;An occasional feeling of inability is common to anyone
	who is accomplishing something.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana sighed.  &ldquo;Then I
	need you to help me cope with my feelings of inability.  If you're
	right about the Moshes, then we're operating under a time constraint
	here.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I promise I'll make time,
	love,&rdquo; he said solemnly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Thanks.  Let's go back
	inside.&rdquo;  They walked back into the core of the tower, where
	soft lighting systems were already adjusting to the fact that the
	sun was setting outside.  Riksana returned to her simulation
	console.  Justin stood behind her chair, and in a gratuitously
	biological gesture, massaged her neck and shoulders for a few
	moments.  Then he bent to kiss her cheek.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'll be back soon,&rdquo;
	he promised softly, and zoned his avatar out of Riksana's world.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">With a bass
	rumble, the ice began to break up and move.  It fractured into slabs
	and sheets, some of which stood on end as they grated together.  The
	whole mass moved ponderously toward a rounded berm layered in deep
	snow.   The cracking spread, racing like branching lightning bolts
	over the frozen lake surface, away from the direction of motion. 
	Nearer to the dam, the ice bulged downward with a groaning,
	crackling sigh as unfrozen water drained away beneath it.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A portion of the earthen berm
	holding back the ice, near the center, now began to subside lower,
	breaking the once-level plane of the snow-covered horizon that
	hemmed in the lake.  As the slow minutes passed, the process
	accelerated.   The center quarter of the dam continued to sag, until
	the bunching flotsam of tiny icebergs that pressed eagerly against
	it began to spill over, carried by the gathering current.   The
	sheets of ice further upstream began to shudder, and threw up a
	shower of ice crystals, like a cloud of thick mist rising from the
	face of the lake, vibrated off its still surface as if trying to
	escape disaster by flying upward into the pale night sky.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The aurora, faintly twisting above
	the surrounding hills, lighted the gathering cataclysm impassively,
	and made gaunt, aghast spectators of the tall pines that thronged
	the looming ridges and ringed the trembling lake shore.   Starlight
	flashed on sudden rents of black water, which struck out across the
	lake from the dying dam like dark anti-lightning on a field of
	white, a reverse-video monochromatic image of destruction.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The center of the dam now
	disappeared entirely beneath a cresting wave of liquid shadow
	flecked with spinning chunks of gleaming ice.   The splintering
	vibration of the ice swelled in a majestic, gelid crescendo as the
	entire lake surface began to shift visibly toward the dam, like a
	vast audience wildly applauding the end of a performance even as it
	streamed out of its seats toward the exits.  The thunderous ovation
	began to be answered from a distance, as a wall of water and
	suspended ice eighty feet high blasted down the riverbed below the

	level space on the upstream side of a sharp bend in its course. 
	Grayish white or silver, even where not covered with snow, they
	looked like handfuls of human habitation thrown haphazardly into a
	pristine wild landscape.   A few leafless deciduous trees arched
	over the paths that had been worn in the snow between the buildings
	by booted feet.  The size of the trees proclaimed that the
	settlement was not new, just as the beaten tracks proved that it was
	inhabited.   A few of the round buildings showed exterior lights,
	but most were dark in the pre-dawn dimness, and none showed lights
	from within.  A couple of caribou wandering through the village on
	their way to or from the water abruptly froze and flattened their
	ears.  After a moment they trotted purposefully away into the forest
	and uphill.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The dim rumbling grew clear, and
	the chattering of the partly frozen stream seemed to go silent. 
	With terrifying suddenness the rumble swelled to a roar.  A door
	opened in one of the buildings, and a man stood there limned in the
	porch light.  He gaped uncomprehendingly at the abrupt apparition of
	what looked like a moving forest, made of spinning and thrashing
	trees frantically stirring a rushing horizontal wall of angry grey
	porridge.  Then he turned and leaped back inside, the door closing

	timber and rolling boulders brushed the valley as clean as if it

	of the lake, toward a gap like a gateway between two earthen hills
	on either hand.  Chunks of ice and a steady stream of sediment
	threatened to choke off the gateway again, but each time the river
	merely gathered its waters against the obstruction and pushed
	through it.  The ice and dirt trickled over the base of the dam and
	down the broad, desolate path through the valley below, where
	gravity steered it in a meandering course amongst the unfamiliar
	obstacles of the river's new bed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It sure sucked
	sometimes, having to put up with the attitude of his allies, Roger
	Sarner reflected.  The Homeland Security Secretary was sitting in a
	borrowed office in Seattle which belonged to one of his
	undersecretaries.  Across the table from him was Reverend Maxwell
	Cleary, whose bespectacled visage was quite familiar to Sarner,
	though he couldn't honestly say that he liked the man very much. 
	Unfortunately he was compelled to treat the little weasel with the
	respect that his organization, if not he himself personally,
	deserved.  Whenever he was in the same general neighborhood as
	Sarner, Cleary had a way of requesting personal meetings at which
	they exchanged updates.  The KOJ had a pathological distrust of
	anything other than in-person communications.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You're positive that the
	Sings haven't put it together, then?&rdquo; Cleary asked, with his
	lips pursed in a disapproving, doubting way that suggested he might
	be disinclined to credit Sarner's competence to answer the question.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner gave him a confident smile
	and waved a hand in a gesture of indulgence.  &ldquo;Put it this
	way, Reverend.  If they had, we'd be seeing surveillance activity
	around the other brain houses that we've targeted.  Which we're not
	seeing.  So a street in Charleston, South Carolina collapses into a
	tunnel that links up with the sewers, so what?  Everyone knows
	street maintenance schedules aren't what they were.  You know how
	many bridges have failed in the Federation in just the last year? 
	Hundreds.  Quite a few don't get replaced these days, either.  At
	least we filled in the street.  No reason to link the cave-in with
	the nearby brain house.  We've taken that particular one off the
	target list anyhow, as a precaution.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Your reasoning is sensible
	enough,&rdquo; Cleary allowed.  &ldquo;Every unusual occurrence can
	hardly be evidence of a plot, after all.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Exactly,&rdquo; Sarner said
	nodding.  Seemed he had the jittery preacher convinced at last. 
	&ldquo;And the Sings are anything but paranoid.  In fact our
	personality profilers keep coming up with results that show most of
	them are overconfident to the point of being almost completely
	oblivious to real world events a lot of the time.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary nodded.  &ldquo;I'm glad to
	hear that we seem to be in agreement that events which plausibly
	look like random disasters won't attract any special scrutiny.  That
	of course is why we simulated a natural disaster in order to
	determine the Sing response to a destroyed brain house.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner's mind raced.  Now it
	sounded like the glib asshole had just been baiting him out with his
	concerns about the tunnel collapse, in order to make it impossible
	for him to disapprove of something the KOJ yahoos had done that was
	Outside The Plan.  Something that he was now going to find out
	about.  Sarner positively hated it when people who weren't supposed
	to do so displayed improvisational behavior.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What natural disaster would
	that be?&rdquo; he asked curtly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You must have heard about
	the old earthen dam that broke the other night during a thaw, a few
	hundred miles north of Vancouver?&rdquo;  Reverend Cleary's tone had
	become slightly peremptory, as if he were brusquely explaining
	something to a child.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes, I heard something
	about it.&rdquo;  Sarner recalled scanning a memo describing the
	event, but couldn't remember the name of the lake, or the valley
	that had been flooded.  &ldquo;Loss of life was slight, under a
	hundred people,&rdquo; he added, pleased to have remembered a detail
	he could proffer as proof.  &ldquo;Your KOJ bunch was responsible
	for that?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You could say so,&rdquo;
	Cleary confirmed with a thin smile.  &ldquo;That is to say, nature
	and gravity did the work, we merely got things rolling by weakening
	the dam with some well-placed explosives.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner blinked at him.  That dam
	was public infrastructure, and the KOJ had most emphatically <I>not</I>
	been given governmental permission to sabotage it.  Time to stop
	coddling the little creep.  &ldquo;What the hell did you do that
	for?&rdquo; he snapped.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary looked insouciantly out the
	window at the omnipresent Seattle winter rain for a moment or two. 
	&ldquo;The object,&rdquo; he explained at last, &ldquo;was to wash
	out what we believe was a major brain house down in the canyon, and
	see what, if anything, the Sings would do about it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Roger Sarner was dumbstruck.  This
	was not only outside the agreed plan, it was downright irresponsible
	and just plain stupid.  &ldquo;There was a brain house below that
	dam?&rdquo; he got out at last.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Some miles downriver, yes.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And you guys destroyed it,
	just to see what would happen?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">More or less.  And I have
	to tell you, so far nothing whatsoever appears to have happened.  No
	one has visited the site of either the brain house or the broken
	dam, thus far.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner was done reasoning with
	this jumped-up religious leader.  &ldquo;Reverend, that is not
	acceptable,&rdquo; he grated in his best nonsense-free tone.  &ldquo;Your
	personnel were engaged to dig tunnels to designated brain house
	targets throughout the Federation.  Nowhere in your mandate is there
	any allowance for sabotaging government property, flooding canyons,
	or destroying enemy brain houses at this time.  In fact, it was
	explicitly agreed that no targets would be destroyed, or any Sings
	liquidated, prior to the commencement of the final phase of the
	operation.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary shrugged.  &ldquo;Well I
	think you can safely say that some Sings were indeed, uh, <I>liquidated</I>
	as you put it,&rdquo; he said with a smirk.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You're missing the point,
	Cleary.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Oh, I got the point, Mr.
	Secretary.   You seem to have missed the point that we're allies,
	not subordinates.  We do not, as a group, work for your government.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm aware of that.  The
	point is, agreements were made.  And signed.  And it's your
	leadership's job to make certain that those agreements are kept, by
	all of your personnel.  Now who was responsible for this little, um,
	initiative?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That would be me, Mr.
	Secretary.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You?  How convenient.  And
	what prompted you to decide to deviate from our agreed-upon
	operating plan?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The fact that we have no
	data, absolutely none at all, on the effect of the destruction of a
	Sing brain house or what the Sings are likely or capable of doing
	about it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So you just decided to
	experiment?  Hasn't it occurred to you that by doing so you may have
	tipped our hand, fired a warning shot across their bow?  What if
	they use this as a reason to build more redundancy into their
	network?  And what the <I>hell</I> do you mean by doing this on your
	own initiative without so much as the courtesy of notifying your own
	government officials?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary sat up straighter and
	leaned toward Sarner, displaying some irritation of his own for the
	first time.  He ticked off points on his fingers as he answered
	Sarner's multiple questions one by one.  &ldquo;Yes, we decided to
	experiment.  Of course tipping our hand occurred to us, but as we
	just now discussed, a disaster which appeared random and natural did
	not seem likely to do that.  Third, we think they have plenty of
	redundancy designed in already, and wanted to gain some insight into
	how much by seeing whether they rebuild the site or attempt to
	recover anything from it.  And lastly, Roger, what the <I>hell</I>
	makes you think I actually need your permission to do anything in
	the first place?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner bit down hard on his
	temper.  God he wanted to kick this little prick's ass right now. 
	But there were other things he wanted more.  &ldquo;My office is
	part of the legitimately constituted government of the North
	American Federation!  As such&ndash;&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As such, your office has no
	business plotting the deliberate destruction of the property, to say
	nothing of the lives, of its own citizens.   Why do you think you've
	been using our KOJ &ldquo;personnel&rdquo;  to do most of your dirty
	work, quite literally?   Because your people can't be seen doing
	such things in case they get caught, and because you simply haven't
	got the manpower.  So don't come on with the &ldquo;official&rdquo;
	crap to me, Roger.  Nothing you've been doing with us is official,
	nothing at all.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Most of what goes on in the
	brain houses is illegal,&rdquo; Sarner returned hotly.  &ldquo;Whenever
	<I>we've</I> destroyed one, it's demonstrably been in the course of
	proper law enforcement.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Try using that as a
	justification to sniveling collaborators like Robert Reynolds!  You
	know as well as I do that your own superiors would disown you in a
	heartbeat if they knew what you were up to with us.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And you should know as well
	as I do that those idiots won't be in charge much longer!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary shrugged and spread his
	hands on the table with studied nonchalance.  &ldquo;Okay, so add
	plotting a coup to your list of official misconduct.  It's all the
	same to us.  We don't consider any government legitimate that
	derives its powers from a secular source.  Legitimate government has
	to be ordained by God.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Ordained by you, you mean,&rdquo;
	Sarner said with a bitter sneer.  He could see where this was going.
	 Someday Cleary hoped to have himself anointed pope and crowned king
	to boot.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Through me, perhaps, but
	not by me,&rdquo; came the smooth reply.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I don't see the
	difference.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I didn't think you would. 
	Now, if you've quite gotten all that out of your system, Roger,
	perhaps we can return to business.  My man on the inside has been
	able to confirm the existence of virtualities that are intended to
	house the Last Trumpet simulacrums.  In my opinion, we should be
	monitoring for increased transmission bandwidth or new nodes that
	may indicate dedicated brain houses coming online.  Do you concur?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner fumbled for a moment,
	caught off guard by the question.  He quickly toted up his options. 
	To accept the change of topic would be to agree implicitly that the
	KOJ could act independently without advance permission.  But it
	seemed that pushing Cleary on that issue right now would not be a
	productive use of his time.  And although Sarner didn't like to
	admit it, the fact was that Cleary was basically right.  The
	agreements they had drawn up between them were unenforceable because
	they could never be made public.  To do so would implicate them
	both, but would hurt Sarner himself much worse than Cleary.  To say
	nothing of scuttling their entire plan, which was far too important
	to risk pursuing a personal quarrel.  He decided to let it go and
	feign tolerance until his position had improved.  Someday after all
	there was going to be a new government, a strong government, and he,
	not Maxwell Cleary, was going to end up at the top of it.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Um, right.  Our people's
	best guess is that since the Last Trumpet folks come back as Full
	Sings, they'll end up getting hosted on the very fastest hardware in
	the same brain houses as the other Full Sings.  So we look for
	existing high-traffic mesh nodes that suddenly spike up in
	bandwidth.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Very good.  And you have
	your people on that monitoring task already?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner forced a grin.  &ldquo;Ferret
	is all over it.&rdquo;  This was one area where he knew he had the
	upper hand over Cleary's bunch.  Their own religion essentially
	forbade them to have anything to do with high technology, so
	monitoring the worldwide mesh was hardly their forte.  Nevertheless,
	somebody in their Order was obviously being permitted a wide
	latitude with hypocrisy.  Cleary had never been very forthcoming
	about his &ldquo;man&rdquo; planted on the Sings, but he was plainly
	a very advanced Sing himself.  Promised a full pardon for his sins,
	no doubt.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Excellent.  You will let me
	know if there are any new targets we should add to the Dig Here
	List?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sure.  And, eh, you will
	let me know if you're going to dynamite any more earthen dams?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reverend Cleary emitted a short,
	barking laugh.  &ldquo;Okay, why not?  Deal.  But I don't think
	we'll need to conduct but the one lone experiment.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well thank God for that,&rdquo;
	Sarner replied in a light, casual tone that was freighted with not
	quite enough sarcasm to elicit objection.  &ldquo;Is that about all
	we had, then, Maxwell?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Suits me, Roger.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">My assistant will see you
	out then, hope to see you again soon.&rdquo;  Both men stood to
	shake hands, with the good-natured enthusiasm derived from hatchets
	buried if not blunted.  Roger Sarner turned and made his way back
	into the outer office for some further consultations with his staff
	in this regional office, which he visited only infrequently.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Maxwell Cleary watched him go
	without regret.  <I>He's a clod, and a brutal one at that</I>, he
	reflected.  Men like Sarner were among the worst that entered public
	service, and they had a disconcerting way of rising consistently to
	positions of prominence.  Sarner was an empty man who ultimately
	believed in nothing but power for its own sake, and sought after
	authority mainly to legitimize and satisfy his own predilection for
	domination and violence.  But at least he did clearly perceive the
	evil of the Sings.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif"><I>Please God, let him keep his
	hostility focused where it belongs for just long enough until it

	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This year's
	coolest New Year's Eve party was in Vokyo.  The virtual city of
	Vokyo, like the ancient meatspace metropolis which had inspired its
	design, was an enormous and complex city that was home to millions. 
	For tonight, in honor of the special occasion, it would play host to
	a guest population that was expected to top one billion.  In order
	to accommodate such a vast number of virtual avatars, the city would
	be instanced about a hundred times over.  An instance was a
	homeomorphic copy of the geometry and NPCs of a virtual space. 
	Various groups of commercial sponsors were underwriting the hosting
	costs for the twenty-four hour period &ndash; twelve hours either
	side of midnight, Tokyo time &ndash; for which the multiple parallel
	instances would be online.  The event was being glibly promoted,
	with some credible justification, as the biggest New Year's party in
	the history of human culture.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma Rivera stood in a posh hotel
	lobby holding hands with her boyfriend, Clay.  In addition to the
	ordinary pleasure of holding hands, doing so also provided some
	practical utility in that it prevented them from being swept apart
	by the streams of fellow travelers that were using this hotel as a
	jumping off place for travel to Vokyo.  The hotel was Bavarian in
	style, ornately white and gilded, though much more brightly lit than
	an eighteenth century original would have been.  But then, no
	Bavarian hotel would have boasted a Tokyo subway entrance just
	outside its front doors, either.  A stream of guests poured down the
	grand staircase from rooms above, or up the smaller flights of
	stairs debouching from the elegant shops situated below, and flowed
	out the hotel's doors, or else milled around on the polished
	hardwood lobby floor as Clay and Salma were doing.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay gestured at a couple
	descending the grand stair, and Salma smiled and waved.  Cylara
	waved back, she and Torch spotting them at almost the same moment. 
	Cylara looked extremely elegant in a full-length silk kimono of a
	warm jade green color.  She seemed to float down the staircase, the
	twinkle of her feet taking the stairs obscured by her clothing. 
	Torch was caparisoned like a Samurai, right down to a pair of curved
	swords.  He had darkened his hair to a dark brown much more in
	keeping with his costume, looking like a stern bodyguard proudly
	escorting a great lady.   Salma and Clay had gone nineteenth century
	Spanish with their dress, with plenty of lace and ruffles.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Wow, what a crush, huh?&rdquo;
	Clay said as the two couples met near the center of the room.  The
	men shook hands and the women embraced briefly and complimented one
	another's outfits.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It's crazy,&rdquo; Torch
	agreed, shaking his head.  &ldquo;I didn't expect this place to be
	so busy.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Me neither.  Well, shall we
	get going?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Both couples clasped hands and
	strode toward the open doors.  Outside was a rendition of a downtown
	street in a German city, late afternoon on a warm spring day, very
	picturesque, complete with horse-drawn carriages, carts and
	well-dressed, bewigged pedestrians &ndash; and the amusingly glaring
	anomaly of a tube station entrance at the edge of the street facing
	the hotel.  Gauche neon lettering over the top of the arch
	advertised &ldquo;Orient Express,&rdquo; automatically rendered in
	each individual beholder's preferred character set and language.  A
	down escalator stood just inside the arch, and with an appreciative
	chuckle, the four friends stepped onto it and descended under the
	street.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Let's hope there's no
	murder on this train, Agatha,&rdquo; quipped somebody ahead of them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Beneath the street was a broad
	platform that fronted the subway tracks.  Even as they neared the
	bottom of the escalator, an empty train pulled to a stop along the
	edge of the platform and opened its doors.  The crowd that had
	gathered on the platform began moving onto the train, but in a
	leisurely manner quite unlike the traditional Tokyo rush-hour style.
	  The foursome moved toward a car that wasn't full yet, so they'd
	have a spot to sit down together.  The train resembled some late
	twentieth century model.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The doors closed (without anyone
	stuffing yet more passengers bodily into the cars; there were some
	touches of historical verisimilitude which were best omitted by
	simulations) and after a moment the train began creeping forward. 
	As it left the station it picked up speed, sliding smoothly and
	quietly along its tracks.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Abruptly the dark tunnel opened
	into a brilliant sunlit space.  The train, moving ever more swiftly,
	sped along a ribbon of track laid along the edge of a bluff
	overlooking a pristine white beach that bordered on a calm,
	turquoise sea, over which the sun was rising.  As it continued to
	pick up speed, the train altered form into something more closely
	resembling a French bullet train than a Japanese subway.  The tracks
	swept gracefully to the left along a promontory bluff, well banked
	to cope with the G-forces, which pressed them gently back into their
	seats.  Then it plunged into another tunnel, bringing darkness
	punctuated by the flicker of passing light panels and the rush of
	speeding air.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Scene change!&rdquo; said
	Cylara with a light laugh.  It was so obvious, but enjoyable
	nonetheless.  This time the train didn't change, the tunnel did. 
	Suddenly it resembled the Chunnel under the English Channel, though
	traversed at a breakneck above-ground velocity.  Continuing to
	accelerate, their train vaulted up and to the right, and emerged
	into daylight again.  It now sped at what had to be near supersonic
	speed along tracks laid at the very surface of a calm ocean,
	straight into the orange ball of a rising sun.   The rush of their
	passage grew to a roar, and the train's vortex sucked a wake of
	glittering spray behind it half as long as the train.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The four of them exchanged
	delighted glances.  This gratuitous scenic approach to what was
	nothing but a glorified zone point was unexpected, but nice.  The
	event promoters were obviously out to make it memorable.  The next
	tunnel appeared ahead as a vast whirlpool into which the tracks
	swooped and disappeared.   A film of water hit the windows with a
	slight jolt as the train dipped into the maelstrom.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">After a heart-stopping moment of
	total blackness, the train transitioned onto a track that still ran
	straight toward the rising sun, but now extended, miraculously
	unsupported, through clouds blushing pink and ocher with the dawn. 
	The earth was an invisible blur below as the train broke the sound
	barrier.  As if adapting itself to supersonic travel, it became ever
	more streamlined and futuristic, a carbon nanosteel frame and glass
	skin replacing the weaker twentieth century materials.   Holographic
	light pulses streamed like heat from the nose of the train and
	ricocheted around the sides of the cars within their translucent
	panels.  As soon as one focused on the lights, their message became
	readable: &ldquo;The future is now.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">If the rising sun
	represents Japan, I wonder if we'll reach it?&rdquo; Clay offered.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It's supposed to be a hot
	party, but probably not quite that hot,&rdquo; Salma replied,
	getting a general laugh from those near them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Without preamble, the train
	executed a leisurely spin on its axis, and as it completed its
	revolution the scene outside changed, like rolling up a shade
	covering a window.   Now they had corkscrewed into a reality that
	was purely abstract.   The track became a mere pulse of light,
	traversing a black and fathomless void in which there was nothing,
	neither land nor sea nor sky nor even any stars.  The sun's disk was
	blotted out as if in an eclipse, leaving only a fiery corona that
	starkly lit the scene.  The light pulses down the train's
	translucent skin began to shift into spectra as they approached
	relativistic velocities.  The letters formed by the pulses had
	changed, yet were still visible as the spectral shifts appeared to
	flow through them.  They read: &ldquo;Celebrate the Singularity!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It now seemed clear that their
	true destination was not the sun, but the event horizon at the edge
	of the sun's disk, which they would presumably reach just as they
	achieved the speed of light.  The symbolism was appropriate, and
	even strangely moving.  The imminence of impact, of arrival, of
	fulfillment, created a moment of tense anticipation even for the
	most jaded of passengers.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There was a soundless starburst of
	every shade of light at once, a faint wrench, and then they were
	coasting calmly down a track within a glass tube, one of many which
	radiated from a common center like wheel spokes, or the limbs of a
	monstrous tinker-toy, toward a ring-shaped starport spinning in
	orbit over what was, unmistakably, Japan under the terminator.  The
	design of the starport was similar to a representation of a complex
	molecule, as if their passage over the event horizon had somehow
	brought them down to the atomic scale.  Each spoke ultimately
	connected up to the orbiting station's outer ring, but at a
	different place &ndash; corresponding, no doubt, to the particular
	instance of Vokyo into which they would zone once they got there. 
	Other trains could be seen traversing their own tubes as they braked
	to a stop along different segments of the ring.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Their train slid smoothly into its
	berth in the starport and came to a complete stop.  The doors
	opened, and the passengers came to their feet.  Quite a few
	applauded as they walked off onto the platform, which once again
	looked incongruously like a subway station.  Viewer-dependent neon
	lettering over the exit arch read &ldquo;Thank you for traveling the
	Orient Express,&rdquo; alternating with &ldquo;Have a Happy New
	Year!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As they rode the escalator up to
	the streets, which zoned them to their chosen instance of Vokyo,
	Torch opined: &ldquo;<I>That</I> was cool.&rdquo;  The others
	agreed, and walked out onto the bustling street, eagerly looking
	forward to an evening spent sampling the varied night life for which
	this virtual city was justly famed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The joyous multitudes,
	representing races and cultures from all over the world, had their
	complete choice of entertainments.  By mutual agreement, the two
	couples opted for some fine dining, followed by a theatrical
	presentation.   The great thing about dining with virtual avatars
	was that one never became hungry, or satiated, or drunk, or sick,
	unless one deliberately chose to experience such reactions.  It was
	all about the sensuous experience of eating and drinking, and the
	social experience of doing it together.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">After the play, they traveled
	partway across town to patronize a sushi bar which was one of
	Salma's favorite spots.  It was particularly suitable for tonight
	because it had a large open patio on the eightieth floor which would
	command a fine view of the fireworks that would shortly be lit off a
	few blocks away.  The place was busy, but they were able to get a
	table out on the patio.  The weather was of course perfect, indeed
	unusually warm for a December night, and the city lights emanating
	and reflecting from neighboring buildings flooded the patio with a
	warm, subtle but variegated multicolored light, not unlike the
	lighting effect produced by a Christmas tree in a dark room.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As they put in orders for their
	favorite sushi rolls, Salma noticed a few familiar faces sitting at
	a neighboring table.  Although she'd been to this very club with
	these people on a number of occasions, the coincidence was somewhat
	remarkable given that tonight, this was only one of about a hundred
	instances of this particular place.  One of her friends noticed her
	at the same moment, and waved.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Several minutes of introductions
	and handshakes and social niceties necessarily followed, as Salma
	introduced everyone who had not met before, and the separate tables
	were pushed closer together.  One woman, a slim redhead named Jenny,
	did not have a date with her tonight.  Which was unusual,
	considering that the last time Salma had seen her, Jenny had been
	with Salma's cousin.  Jenny's responses to greetings were somewhat
	subdued, which made Salma wonder what had happened.  But she
	certainly wasn't going to ask Jenny about it directly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Instead she got the attention of
	one of the men seated closer to her, and asked him.  &ldquo;So,
	where is Arturo tonight?&rdquo; she inquired, <I>sotto voce</I>. 
	The man shot her a curious look, then a somewhat pained one.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You don't know?&rdquo; he
	replied softly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No, I'm afraid I don't. 
	That would be why I asked.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He faced her more squarely, spoke
	steadily but quietly.  &ldquo;Arturo couldn't be here tonight.  He's
	dead.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Conversation dropped off as the
	words registered around the two tables.  Salma found herself gaping
	stupidly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Dead?&rdquo; she queried,
	hoping this would turn out to be some joke.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Jenny was now looking straight at
	her.  Salma met her eyes, saw pain reflected there.  Jenny nodded
	her head ever so slightly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He was caught in a flood
	when a dam broke in British Columbia,&rdquo; the man continued. 
	&ldquo;Killed instantly.  I'm sorry.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma nodded, feeling loss but
	also a touch of shame because the man had been her cousin and she
	hadn't known about a death in the family.  &ldquo;I'm sorry for your
	loss,&rdquo; she said across the table to Jenny.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Likewise,&rdquo; Jenny
	returned, then dropped her eyes to the plate before her, where some
	sushi chef's concoctions stood untouched, toothpicks projecting
	upward awaiting grasping fingers.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well that news sort of puts
	a damper on the evening,&rdquo; Torch commented, but in a
	lighthearted tone.  Jenny looked up sharply.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No, please don't let it do
	that.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma also shook her head, and
	breathed her own soft denial.  At that moment some sake arrived, and
	one of the men in Jenny's party took the opportunity to propose a
	toast.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">To the future, and to
	friends present and friends remembered.&rdquo;  Glasses were raised
	and clinked together all around.  It was nearly midnight.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">From somewhere the plaintive
	strains of Auld Lang Syne began to play, in a fitting tribute to
	west coming together with east under the brilliant night sky.  Some
	hummed, some sang along, some merely sipped their sake.  Only
	seconds after the final verse ended, the fireworks began.  The view
	from this location was spectacularly unobstructed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Any display using fireworks which
	were unconstrained by material physical laws took on a different
	character from purely traditional fireworks.  Not all of the effects
	and components were ballistic.  Some followed Newtonian trajectories
	in an obvious homage to fireworks of the chemical kind, right back
	to the Chinese invention of the art so many centuries ago.  Others
	blatantly defied gravity, or progressed backwards from a full
	flowering display down to a single silent point, shrinking instead
	of expanding.  Colors were mixed with sounds and a color palette
	employed which would have been unachievable through chemical
	combustion.  It was part laser light show, part abstract art, and
	partly a barrel-chested instantiation of a traditional display.  It
	was all superb.  The designers had outdone themselves.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But the real surprise came when
	the starport orbiting above the city contributed an answering
	barrage of simulated meteors and comets, which descended toward the
	earth like the onset of Armageddon, only to disintegrate into
	sparkling dust in the lower troposphere.  That was the finale, and
	it got a cheering, stomping, standing ovation from a good billion
	dazzled human intelligences.  The fearless blending of aspects of
	traditional culture with Singularity technology was lost on no one. 
	The future was indeed now, and all things lay within human reach.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As the applause died down, and
	people hugged and laughed and drank more toasts and wished one
	another Happy New Year in a dozen tongues, Clay became smitten with
	an audacious notion that took shape in his mind like an exploding
	firework.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Look, everybody...&rdquo;
	he began, gesturing for the attention of those around him.  The
	others thought he was about to propose another toast or something
	and accorded him their polite interest.  &ldquo;Now this is the
	future, right?  It's the Singularity.  And the Singularity is all
	about removing the limitations of the past.  One of those
	limitations is death.  Well, enough feeling loss and grief already. 
	Why should we have to accept that Arturo is dead, and isn't coming
	back to us?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There was a brief, eyebrow-raising
	silence.  One of the men, a British chap who'd sung Auld Lang Syne
	passably in its original Scottish dialect, saluted Clay with his
	sake glass.  &ldquo;If you're talking about putting Art's name in
	for the Last Trumpet Project, old man, we've already done that.  But
	the line's rather long right now, mate, and there's no telling
	when&ndash;&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No doubt, but I'm
	personally acquainted with Stefan Jager himself,&rdquo; Clay
	interrupted.  Heads turned.  &ldquo;Not to be a name-dropper or
	anything, but it's true.  I did some work for him once.&rdquo; 
	Torch gave him an incredulous look, as if to say: &ldquo;Why didn't
	you mention this before?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And you think you could get
	the request expedited?&rdquo; Jenny asked excitedly.  Clay finished
	his sake and set down the tiny glass.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I think it's certainly
	worth a try.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma beamed and stepped close to
	him.  &ldquo;I agree.  I'll go with you.  I don't want this to be
	true.  I don't want it to stand, that my cousin is dead.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Who would?&rdquo; Clay
	asked, and gave her a quick kiss.  Jenny came over to express her
	gratitude, and gave Clay her contact information.  The gathering
	continued, as people milled around the tables striking up new
	conversations on more neutral topics, sampling sushi off of
	platters, ordering up more drinks.  Before long, they would break up
	the party and begin to head homeward.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The echo of the orbital fireworks
	seemed to linger in the mind's eye, like a flaming challenge flung
	against the night sky, against fate, against the darkness of the
	past.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara Janovic
	willed herself awake, deactivating the sensory interface bypass on
	her nanocomp neocortex.  Virtual reality faded as the input feed
	from her biological senses took over.   Her eyes opened, and out of
	habit she took a shallow breath.  She was floating in a sleep
	capsule filled with an aqueous solution, buoyed up by the smart skin
	which encased her body like a wet suit.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Drain for emergence,&rdquo;
	she said clearly, and in response to the command, the fluid level in
	the tank-like chamber began to drop.  Shortly her supine form came
	to rest on a soft platform like a mattress, above which she had been
	floating.  She stretched and flexed her fingers and toes.  Virtual
	bodies didn't feel noticeably different, but there was still
	something satisfying about feeling the sensory feedback from her
	own.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The drained capsule opened to one
	side, and she swung her legs out of bed and stood up.  She
	experienced no dizziness, despite the length of time she had been
	recumbent.  The capsule bed stood at one side of her bedroom, with a
	more prosaic four-poster king size one situated opposite to it.  
	The door to her huge walk-in closet stood open.  She walked over to
	it and stripped off the smart skin bodysuit she had been wearing,
	hanging it up carefully.  There was a full length mirror on the
	door, which she faced.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara would be forty-three this
	year, having been born in the year 2002.  The body in the mirror
	looked a very athletic twenty.    Perfect proportions, flawless
	skin, excellent muscle tone.  Fashion model good looks.  She spent a
	few moments twisting around in and out of profile, studying her
	image intently.  She had left instructions for the suit to stimulate
	enough fat cell growth to add another centimeter to both her breasts
	and her hips.  Now that she could see the results, she wasn't
	entirely sure whether she liked the effect or not.  Oh well, it was
	a micro-optimization anyway, and in truth it had been several years
	since she had experienced a romantic encounter in her biological
	body.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She had been in her immersion
	capsule continuously for almost seven weeks.   During that time she
	had visited hundreds of virtualities, for work, play, romance, even
	rest.  There were times though, when she needed to check in with
	meatspace reality.  Although the suit kept her clean, fed, and even
	shaved where she wanted to be, she still took a nice long shower by
	way of waking up and acclimating to her body again.  Briskly
	selecting a set of garments from her closet, she was soon dressed
	casually and comfortably.  She paused a moment in front of the
	mirror to set the color palette values on her outfit to a
	combination that looked aesthetically pleasing, then turned to the
	far wall, drew another breath, and spoke to it.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Window, true vision,&rdquo;
	she said.  A section of the wall became a window, letting in the
	natural light from the exterior of her house.  The view showed a
	late afternoon sky, a bit leaden with tattered low clouds,
	interspersed with some blue patches.  The grounds outside the house
	looked damp, but it did not appear to be raining at the moment.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She strode down the hallway from
	her bedroom, which led to a landing, where she descended a short
	carpeted stairway down to a larger living area.  A holoscreen was
	already active at a table, with a steaming mug of creamed coffee
	fixed just the way she liked it, in the dispenser nearby.  Cylara
	sighed as she picked up the coffee and sat down at the table in
	front of the screen.  As she did so, a face not unlike Cylara's own
	appeared in the projection, shown seated against a background that
	looked like an office.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Hello, Paia,&rdquo; Cylara
	greeted the apparition.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Hello, mistress Cylara,&rdquo;
	came the response, which seemed actually to emanate from the
	hologram image as its lips moved.  The voice was a little darker and
	less expressive than Cylara's own, but did not sound artificial;
	more like that of a very businesslike young woman with a job to do. 
	&ldquo;Are you well?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Very well, thank you. 
	What's the news?  Did I miss anything?&quot;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I have prepared a briefing
	report on world events which you may have missed during your
	immersion period, grouped according to scientific, cultural, and
	economic headings, as you specified.  This is in your news folder
	when you are ready to review it.  You have received thirty-seven
	personal contacts which were not junk yet did not meet your criteria
	for forwarding to you in real time.  On the business front, I'm
	pleased to report that last quarter's royalties topped an aggregate
	of one million copy instantiations for the first time.  This has
	moved our search presence to the next level in several distribution
	channels, which does appear to be stimulating further sales.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara was, among other things, a
	fashion designer.   Digital specifications of her designs for
	clothing and accessories were made available in a large number of
	virtualities, and whenever someone selected one of her unique
	designs, a micro fee was collected as a royalty.   Good virtual
	realities were detailed and complex, and even the most accomplished
	world designers weren't always capable (or terribly interested) in
	providing their own best-of-show accessories for items like
	clothing, transport vehicles, tools, weapons, foodstuffs, buildings,
	equipment and accouterments of all descriptions which might be used
	by visitors to that particular cyberverse world.  So as a rule they
	sub-contracted such accessories out to specialist designers like
	Cylara, who distributed their digital property for sale through a
	network of marketing channels that acted as middlemen, matching up
	the needs of virtual spaces with the products available.  Open and
	voluntary digital data specification standards ensured that an
	outfit Cylara had designed would look and feel the same in any
	virtual world which supported the standards.  Which in practice was
	almost all of them, although custom closed specification worlds did
	exist.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As with anything else, competition
	and market pricing determined just how much of any particular
	virtual good or service was required.  Cylara employed Paia (her
	customized Personal Artificial Intelligence Assistant) to monitor
	sales and track the demand and prices paid for different articles of
	apparel, across a whole matrix of cyberverse virtual realities (or
	virtualities, to use the colloquial term).  Sometimes the highest
	return for effort involved creating a very popular item widely used
	in many virtualities, or in a few extremely popular ones.  Sometimes
	it involved designing specialty items which filled a low volume
	niche in marginal virtualities.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In the interest of efficiency,
	Cylara tried to supply items which she enjoyed creating and which
	also addressed a currently existing market opportunity.  Since
	virtualities themselves fluctuated in popularity, and therefore in
	their access pricing, and new ones were always being deployed, the
	global market was in a constant state of flux.  Even Paia's very
	sophisticated demand projection module which utilized chaos theory
	algorithms didn't always get it right &ndash; possibly partly
	because so many other market players likewise employed similar
	market modeling techniques.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">These sales figures were
	definitely good news.  Although Cylara made a modest income from her
	work, significant brand name recognition had always eluded her, and
	such recognition was more or less a requirement for vaulting up to
	the next level of success.  &ldquo;Excellent, Paia,&rdquo; she
	breathed softly over her coffee.  &ldquo;How are profits?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Rising along with sales.  A
	directive is now required on whether to purchase expanded computing
	cycles today, or purchase more leveraged options on future cycles.&rdquo;
	 This was basically a trade-off between current consumption and
	larger deferred consumption in the future.  All of the software that
	Cylara ran, from the climate control and self-maintenance programs
	which kept her house heated, cooled, cleaned, and its grounds
	immaculate, that kept her alive and safe and healthy while she was
	virtually immersed, and made her coffee when she got up, to Paia and
	her business operations, to the computing power she needed in order
	to run the client side of the virtualities she accessed, all needed
	to be hosted somewhere.   Much of that was run on hardware installed
	here in her own home.  The remainder of those cycles were leased or
	purchased elsewhere, and accessed at light-speed via a seamless
	wireless network.  All of that computing power and network bandwidth
	had to be paid for, along with eventual upgrade costs as the
	technology evolved.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Paia put up a graph, offering a
	recommendation.   She was proposing a small increment to their
	wireless bandwidth budget, which would provide them with
	approximately fifteen percent more throughput and a twenty percent
	higher burst level.  Along with that would go another modular CPU
	for their main house server, and an upgrade to Paia's econometric
	module.  There was also a slated expansion to their offsite data
	storage, which was showing eighty-seven percent utilization.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">On the investment side, Paia was
	proposing the addition of two more futures contracts to Cylara's
	portfolio.  Both of these involved companies that were developing
	promising, if speculative, new technologies.  One was growing
	diamondoid circuitry in a zero-G environment on its own satellite
	positioned at one of the Lagrange points, and the other was
	developing cold computing CPUs on the floor of the Indian Ocean
	which were powered by the motion of deep ocean currents.  The former
	company was anticipating breakthroughs in quantum networking which
	would render their space-based computing cycles accessible for
	real-time applications, while the latter pursued a vision of growing
	quasi-organic computing hardware across the ocean bottom, rather
	like a deep water subspecies of coral.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Both companies' methodologies were
	proven, but the amount of useful computing cycles which the projects
	of each would produce, relative to the cost of standard technology,
	was still very unclear.  This was why, to raise capital, the
	companies sold futures contracts for very large numbers of computing
	cycles to be delivered by specific dates.  The market priced the
	value of those contracts according to its estimate of the likelihood
	of successful on-time delivery.  Right now Paia's modeling was
	suggesting that the current price of those contracts was lower than
	their probable actual value.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara pondered for a few moments,
	accessing some of the networked computing resources available
	outside of her own head as she studied the supporting data behind
	Paia's choices.  &ldquo;I like your resource allocations, and will
	approve them with one exception,&rdquo; she said at last.  &ldquo;I
	think we can skip the offsite storage upgrade.  I'll spend some time
	going over the files.  I'm sure there are some things we can delete
	to make more room.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Paia's image nodded.  &ldquo;Very
	well, mistress.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara took another sip of
	delicious coffee.    Her body was imbued with metabolic nanobots
	that supplied all of her cells with the precise balance of nutrients
	which they required for optimal function, right down to
	phytochemicals and trace minerals.  Her body's energy was provided
	by microscopic hydrogen fuel cells.  As a result, she only ate or
	drank &ndash; coffee or anything else &ndash; for the flavor and
	warmth and scent and texture of what she consumed.  Elimination
	nanobots would ultimately dispose of the coffee.  &ldquo;And how's
	the mining project going?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Projected yields are low
	thus far, but much of the property has now been mapped,&rdquo; Paia
	replied in her brisk, efficient tone.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Good.  You know, I think
	I'll take along my coffee and have a walk around outside.  Where's
	the miner bot at the moment?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">On the east side of the
	lot.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As Cylara stood up from the table,
	Paia's holographic facial image detached itself from the screen,
	floated over next to Cylara, and took on a complete human form,
	albeit one that shimmered slightly, especially when looked at
	indirectly.  Mobile holograms typically didn't look totally
	convincing, but it was handy to have Paia be able to provide a
	visual reference point as they continued to interact over her audio
	link.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara strolled through the living
	room and over to the front door, which unlocked itself and swung
	open in response to her voiceprint.  Her front porch was fronted by
	rhododendrons, yews, and other perennial and evergreen shrubbery,
	though none of this was flowering since it was January.  The
	manicured lawns were neat and green.  The air was cool but not
	uncomfortable, damp but not quite misty.  A faint breeze blew,
	stirring in the tattered brown leaves still clinging to the large
	oak tree which graced her front yard.  She walked slowly around the
	house, noting the condition of the plantings and the exterior of the
	house.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Has there been much snow?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Less than five inches total
	so far this season,&rdquo; Paia replied immediately.  &ldquo;Overall
	precipitation has been eight percent above normal.  Temperature has
	varied within normal ranges.&rdquo;  Pretty typical for a winter in
	western coastal Washington.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Paia indicated that the mining
	robot was presently in the backyard, actually in the woods in a
	corner of the lot just outside the grass border.  Cylara walked that
	way, with the glistening hologram beside her.  Paia's image was
	being generated by a small hovering projector, but this was
	disguised by its being contained within her holographic body space. 
	The projector's audio and video interfaces were connected via a
	wireless network to Paia's software running on the house CPU.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The mining robot was a boxy oblong
	grey thing with six deep-treaded wheels, like a miniature ATV, about
	five feet from end to end.  It had a number of utility arms,
	sensors, drills and such mounted on top of it, which could swing out
	over the ground.  This particular type of robot was actually a
	portable nanobot colony rather than a robotic digger.  It drilled
	holes only to deploy billions of microscopic nanites which moved
	through the soil in search of whatever minerals they were programmed
	to find.  Rather like an army of tiny ants ferrying food back to
	their nest, the nanites locked onto particles of the desired
	minerals and dragged them back to the bot for collection and
	storage.  The robot's AI controlled the nanites using a dedicated
	wireless network.  </FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara had
	instructed it to quarter her entire property gradually, performing
	spectrographic analysis of core samples from different depths to
	deduce where best to deploy the nanites, which were then sent down
	to map out the overburden in minute detail.  It was capable of
	recharging, repairing, and even replacing its full rated complement
	of nanites, so that its operation could continue indefinitely, so
	long as its fuel cells lasted and raw materials were supplied.  This
	particular model had cells which were rated for up to five years of
	continuous use, and a lot of the materials needed could be recycled
	or obtained via its own mining efforts.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In the interest of efficiency, the
	robot's initial task was to map the property thoroughly, from the
	surface down to a depth of about thirty feet.  The nanites could be
	operated even deeper, but due to their extremely slow travel speeds,
	greater depths quickly became impractical.  Paia informed her
	mistress that the mapping project now stood seventy-two percent
	completed after the nearly ten weeks of operations thus far.  The
	robot periodically uploaded its results to its control software on
	the house computer, where Paia kept track of it.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Because the robot's nanites had
	sifted through so much of the overburden on the property at such a
	fine granularity, they now knew the location of every bit of
	commercially valuable mineral over nearly three quarters of the
	subject area.  Once the mapping was complete, the AI control
	software would analyze the data to design a mining program which
	would maximize value recovered per unit time, and download it into
	the miner bot.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">When the robot had accumulated an
	economically meaningful weight of a particular mineral, it would
	send a signal to the company from which Cylara had leased it.  They
	would dispatch a specially equipped pizza bot to link with the
	miner, upload the recovered minerals, and transport them back to the
	company for processing and eventual sale.  The value realized would
	be split between the mining company and Cylara, as per their agreed
	contract.  The robot essentially earned its manufacturers a
	commission on the client's minerals.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This property is not
	especially mineral-rich, but as you can see there is enough
	recoverable iron, gold, and silver alone to make the operation
	economic,&rdquo; Paia reported.  Cylara was studying, on her
	heads-up retinal display, 3D colored graphs created by the bot
	depicting the density and location of discovered amounts of those
	and other minerals.  She could readily see that Paia was correct. 
	In fact, it looked a little better than she had been expecting.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What's the production
	timeline projection?&rdquo; she asked next.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Assuming that the remainder
	of the property roughly conforms to the distribution seen in the
	first seventy-two percent, the mining program will remain
	profitable, at current market prices, for approximately three years.
	 After that time the operation will be marginal for up to an
	additional two years.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Hmm, better than we hoped.&rdquo;
	 This deal with the robot mining company had looked like such a
	no-brainer that Cylara had actually been suspicious of it.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Indeed, mistress.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Make sure that the gold and
	silver ends up in Aurumnet.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Confirmed,&rdquo; Paia said
	with a nod.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Aurumnet was an anonymous,
	decentralized network for monetizing precious metals, especially
	gold.  It operated as a private distributed mint which produced
	digital coinage.  Those who had physical precious metals, like
	Cylara, could offer their metal to Aurumnet.  Customers identified
	themselves via their personal control of unique, quantum encryption
	keys, and using these, submitted the details of their request. 
	Aurumnet's AI would turn the prospective client over to a fair
	witness in the client's area, who would make arrangements to inspect
	and take possession of the metal.  The fair witness provided a
	certified data block attesting to the weight and fineness of the
	metal inspected.  The metal itself was then transported to a
	warehousing location, one of many thousands around the world, each
	containing relatively small amounts of metal, controlled by a bailee
	chartered by Aurumnet.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Once the metal was safely stored
	by the bailee, Aurumnet would mint unique digital coins
	corresponding to the weight of the metal, less a small minting fee
	which paid for the services of the fair witness, the bailee, and the
	Aurumnet mint itself.  Those digital coins then became messages
	encrypted to the client's public key.  Anytime Cylara wanted to
	spend her coins, she could do so by generating a digitally signed
	and encrypted axiomatic token and sending it back to Aurumnet,
	specifying the public key of the party to whom she wished to
	surrender the digital coins.  Those were then re-issued to the new
	holder by the mint network, encrypted with the new holder's unique
	key.  Any leftover change would be re-minted and returned to Cylara.
	 Naturally, electronic wallet abstractions overlaid these details
	for everyday use in the global cyberverse marketplace, so that
	spending was as easy as shaking hands, sending a private message, or
	handing over a coin.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Aurumnet employed an AI auditor
	which monitored and balanced the aggregate metals holdings at all of
	the bailees versus the sum of all circulating digital coins,
	continuously in real time.  It also utilized physical auditors who
	randomly double-checked the bailee holdings at warehouses and the
	reports of fair witnesses for accuracy.  These physical auditors
	received bounties on any discrepancies which they documented.  The
	metal holdings were individually insignificant and scattered all
	over the world.  The bailees, fair witnesses, and auditors were all
	kept anonymous, authenticated via encryption challenges against
	their keys posted on the Aurumnet keyserver.  </FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Aurumnet
	network itself was highly distributed so that its data stores and
	control logic were spread across computers around the world, with
	the pieces migrating from one host system to another at random
	intervals and communicating only via unbreakable quantum
	entanglement encryption.  Because of these features, the system was
	believed to be impervious to effective attack.   Losses due to fraud
	or counterfeiting had never yet risen to anywhere near one percent
	annually; a much better record than any other currency in human
	history.  No criminals, whether internal or external to Aurumnet, in
	the private sector or the government sector, had ever managed to
	compromise the system.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Aurumnet did of course have a
	number of competitors that performed similar services with gold or
	other stores of value.  In a free market for money, it was merely
	the largest and best known currency issuer.  Which was why Cylara
	wanted to bail her gold into its system.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Back in 2036, when researchers at
	the Solomon Institute for Quantum Physics had proved and patented
	their techniques for subatomic reconfiguration, it technically
	became possible literally to create any element out of smaller atoms
	and subatomic particles.  The discovery had temporarily caused a
	sharp drop in the market price of gold relative to other
	commodities, based on the anticipation of future inflation in the
	global supply of the metal.  But since Au79 is a relatively heavy
	element, it turned out that the amount of energy and effort required
	to synthesize it from base particles essentially ate up most of the
	value of the gold created.  At that point the price rebounded,
	eventually finding an equilibrium point where the cost and
	difficulty of obtaining more gold equaled the cost and difficulty of
	obtaining other goods priced at an equivalent weight in gold.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara's mining venture was not
	going to make her rich, but it would provide some supplemental
	income over time.  Nodding at the miner bot as if to say &ldquo;carry
	on,&rdquo; she sipped some more coffee and continued her stroll
	around her house.  Paia followed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The house sat on about six acres,
	of which a bit more than half was fully landscaped.   After nearly
	twenty years, the plantings had become fairly mature.  In the seven
	years that Cylara had owned the property, she had made only modest
	changes and additions.  She no longer found herself interested in
	making any.  In fact, as she walked around the dwelling on this mild
	early January day, something about the entire scene struck her as
	depressing.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What, after all, was the point of
	having a nice house out in the country which you seldom visited, and
	that was in any case vastly more humdrum and prosaic than most of
	the virtual locations where she normally spent her time?  She could
	live in a palace if she wanted, or a fine hotel.  She could live in
	an underwater city or a space colony on another planet.  Anything in
	real reality, no matter how nice you tried to make it, was going to
	look dumpy and dull by comparison.  These days all she could bring
	herself to do was provide for the necessary upkeep to prevent decay,
	because that really <I>would</I> be depressing to wake up to.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not for the first time, Cylara
	wondered why she bothered to wake up at all.  Her life was almost
	entirely situated in the cyberverse these days.  She designed her
	products in her virtual workshop, not in the studio in this house.  
	Her recreational time was spent in a thousand places, just as the
	whim took her.  Even her relationships were in the cyberverse.  She
	visited family and friends regularly, but hadn't seen any of them in
	the flesh in years.  And then there was Torch, her current
	boyfriend.   She felt a growing and profound attachment there,
	despite the fact that they had never even met in person.  She didn't
	know for sure how old he was, where he came from, or what he looked
	like.  Nor, she was sure, did he know those things about her.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She stopped and took a seat on a
	stone bench near one of her dormant flower beds, drained off the
	last of her coffee and set the mug beside her.  She clasped her arms
	around her body, feeling a sudden chill.  It was not, after all, all
	<I>that</I> warm out here.   She felt the warmth of her own embrace,
	and reflected that it really didn't feel any different than the same
	action would in a virtual body.  She took a deep breath of the damp,
	loamy cool air, and let it out slowly.  The respirocites in her
	lungs and bloodstream would process that single breath so
	efficiently that she could go without drawing breath again for
	several hours if she wanted.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Nanobots embedded in her body's
	muscle tissue gently exercised every muscle in her body even when
	she wasn't using them.  The result was a perfect tone.  Monitoring
	sensors woven right into her clothing scanned continuously for
	tissue damage, microbial incursions, even cells dividing with
	imperfectly copied DNA.  Any threat to the integrity of her body's
	trillions of cells was immediately detected and remediated by the
	medical nanobots invisibly coexisting with her biological cells. 
	Because those trillions of molecular machines were controlled
	through a wireless network emanating from a module installed in the
	server in her house, the whole system was configurable.  While
	wearing the smart suit that she had used in the immersion capsule,
	the system could supply her every cell with nutrients, repair
	anything that went wrong, even gradually reprogram her DNA.  In
	theory she could live for years in that suit, never aging or
	suffering any disease or decay or discomfort, not even so much as
	ordinary hunger or thirst.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was a miracle.  It was beyond
	magic.  She was immortal, perfect, a textbook incarnation of Woman. 
	 She could tap almost any knowledge in the world just by thinking
	about it.  She could remember anything.  She could read and even
	memorize a novel in a few seconds if she wished.  She could
	understand any known language that had ever been spoken by human
	beings.  New skills were available to her as quickly as she could
	locate and download them.  If she wanted to take up ballet, she
	could be dancing on point in minutes.  Throughout every era of human
	history but this one, they would have called what she was a goddess.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara knew she looked the part.  
	Flawless classical features, five foot seven and 120 perfectly
	arranged pounds, her face could have launched two thousand ships,
	and her naked body could give guys stiffies at fifty paces.  She was
	Helen, she was Venus, she was Athena.  Ancient civilizations would
	have sung her praises and worshiped her above all others.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And yet here she sat, wondering
	what was the use of keeping this flesh, this form, this biological
	perfection.  Was it mere vanity, or was it fear that kept her
	returning to resume residence in this squishy shell from time to
	time?   Fear that she was after all but a mortal woman, and that
	should the day ever come when the thoughts she thought or the
	emotions that she felt were no longer even partly carried by the
	neurons firing in her brain, that on that day she would perish?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She knew that this was not a
	rational fear.  Already most of her thinking, and quite a lot of her
	feelings, took place on non-biological computer hardware separate
	from the neurons and spindle cells in her cranium.  If the
	proportion ever became a hundred percent, what difference would that
	make to her persistent organizing pattern, which was the essence of
	her unique identity, whether that pattern inhabited flesh or
	circuitry, and was embodied in chemical reactions, or in electrical
	currents, or in molecular interactions?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara ran her fingers through the
	thick silk of her blond hair, over the smooth softness of her face,
	down to cup the pointed fullness of her breasts, around the sleek
	firmness of her rounded hips, and finally brought them together in
	the taut, muscular heat between her thighs.  She shivered again. 
	Something in this body was <I>her</I>, there was no better way to
	put it than that, even though her virtual bodies were closely based
	on this one, and in truth looked and felt at least as good.  Was she
	so laughably in love with this comely female flesh that she couldn't
	bear to part with it?  Was it her pride in the fact that her real
	body, her natural body, was so much hotter than the real bodies of
	most other women?  Yet what good was that, anyhow?  Everyone looked
	exactly how they wanted to in the cyberverse, and never knew (or
	usually even cared) what the other person's &ldquo;real body&rdquo;
	looked like &ndash; or if they even had one, or if it was the same
	gender as their avatar if they did.  Perhaps her problem <I>was</I>
	vanity, after all.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Or was there a problem in the
	first place?  What after all was the issue with keeping a small part
	of herself biological?   It meant keeping this house, and coming
	back to it once in a while.  Not that she actually needed to, unless
	she wanted to experience existence through her original senses.  She
	could and did meet with Paia regularly when immersed.  In fact it
	was more convenient to call on Paia in her own office, rather than
	pull Paia out here into Cylara's meatspace garden as a cumbersome
	hologram, drifting along like a ghost.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Paia was watching her mistress
	with an expression of concern.  &ldquo;You are troubled, Cylara?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The mistress sighed, but faintly,
	having neglected to take an enabling breath first.  &ldquo;Not
	really troubled, dear Paia, just wondering why I keep coming back
	here when it doesn't do anything to make me happy.   Being in my
	body makes me a bit moody, in fact.  Maybe I should become more like
	you.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Paia's smile flickered, having
	recognized the attempt at a wry jest.  &ldquo;Would you like me to
	investigate current procedures and costs for transitioning to a Full
	Sing, mistress?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Somehow this was awkward.  Cylara
	knew that Paia was quite a bit brighter than the average biological
	human.  Certainly her memory and data analysis abilities were much
	greater, although her personality was thankfully missing most of the
	quirks and eccentricities that would normally accompany such
	intellectual gifts in a Mosh.  Cylara was the mistress because,
	well, because Paia was a program which Cylara ran on computer
	resources which she controlled.   But if the woman ever became as
	purely virtual as her programmed assistant, then they would both be
	programs running on computer substrates, and what then would
	separate them, except the fact that Cylara selfishly allocated more
	and better resources to herself?   Cylara had bought Paia from a
	software company fifteen years ago, and had lavished almost every
	upgrade and enhancement on her that she could afford.  Paia was more
	than an assistant, she was a friend, a business partner, almost like
	a sister.  Cylara cared about Paia, and wanted her to be happy, even
	knowing that she wasn't strictly programmed to seek happiness for
	herself.  She could no more switch Paia off than she could strangle
	a child.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Becoming a Full Sing would
	definitely mark a watershed in their long relationship.  Perhaps
	Cylara wouldn't need Paia anymore.  Or perhaps she could integrate
	her into herself.   But change seemed certain.   And so the
	question, though mildly and earnestly asked, felt like Paia offering
	to sacrifice herself.  Cylara felt an answering twinge of pain, of
	guilt, of incipient regret.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No, my friend, I don't
	think that will be necessary right now.  I just get these moods. I
	seem to go round in circles in my mind, I feel like I don't know
	what to do.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Paia nodded silently.  Then she
	proved that after long acquaintance with her mistress, her
	programming was sophisticated enough to intuit how Cylara's mind
	worked.   &ldquo;I am attuned to you now, and would find it
	difficult to serve another.   But I want you to be happy.  I don't
	want you to hold yourself back for my sake.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara's eyes misted with tears. 
	She wanted to embrace her friend, but clutching at a hologram would
	be silly and pointless.  &ldquo;I couldn't bear to go on to such
	things without you,&rdquo; she said after a moment, striving to keep
	her tone neutral.  &ldquo;We'll stay together, whatever happens.  I
	promise.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Very well, mistress.  You
	appear to be getting cold sitting there.  Would you like to go back
	into the house now?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara stood, picking up her empty
	mug.  &ldquo;Yes, I would.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As she walked with Paia back
	toward her door, she reflected that she could certainly afford to
	spend at least one day hanging out around the house.  She hadn't
	committed to be anywhere until the day after tomorrow, when she'd
	promised to meet Torch.  He'd said he had some &ldquo;real life&rdquo;
	issues of his own to take care of.  A bit odd, really.  Who called
	meatspace real life anymore?  The cyberverse was just as real these
	days.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">His reaction to the idea of
	getting Salma's cousin Arturo resurrected by the Last Trumpet
	Project had been a little strange, too.  Almost like he didn't want
	to encourage it, but felt he couldn't say anything against it.  Why
	would he be opposed to the idea, especially after he dragged them
	all off to that New York City simulation?  Changing his mind about
	the Project?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She supposed there would be a lot
	of that kind of reassessment going on.  The metaphysical aspects
	were one hell of a tangled mess.  Personally, she never worried too
	much about metaphysics.  She had some hangups and concerns about
	giving up her original human body, but that certainly wasn't because
	of her soul.  Cylara tended to equate her conscious awareness with
	her soul anyway, as she supposed most people did.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Maybe she ought to have a
	conversation with her guy on the topic of souls.  That might prove
	interesting.  Although really she didn't care what her lovers
	believed, as long as they were fun to be with, treated her nice,
	turned her on, and took her to the moon in bed.  Torch was certainly
	all that.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She'd not been up for even an
	hour, and already she was somehow weary, though of course not
	physically.  &ldquo;The jaded goddess is tired of this already,&rdquo;
	she muttered with a wry grin.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	do sit down.&rdquo;  Paia gestured to a couple of comfortable padded
	chairs which waited in front of her desk.   All three of them were
	seated.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Thank you for allowing us
	to make this appointment,&rdquo; Clay said.  He recognized that many
	Paias made such decisions without even contacting their principals,
	and wanted to make sure that this one understood that her good
	judgment was appreciated.  Paia nodded politely and waited for him
	to proceed.  &ldquo;We asked to see you in reference to one Arturo
	Scalleni, recently deceased, whose name has been submitted to the
	Project for temporal digital recreation.&rdquo;  Clay was
	deliberately careful to use the correct technical term, TDR, rather
	than the slang terminology of resurrection.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Paia nodded understandingly.  &ldquo;You
	are of course aware that at this time it is hardly possible to
	expedite all such requests received.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Of course.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma stirred.  &ldquo;Clayton
	makes this request on my behalf, Paia.  Arturo was my first cousin.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Paia's impassive face did not go
	so far as to wince, but definitely registered empathetic regret as
	her eyes met Salma's.  &ldquo;My condolences on your loss, Ms.
	Rivera.  However, the circumstances stand.  How did Mr. Scalleni
	die?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay and Salma exchanged a glance.
	 &ldquo;He perished in a flood.  The riverside community in which he
	lived was swept away when a dam broke in the middle of the night
	upstream,&rdquo; Salma replied.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Ah yes, we've received a
	number of TDR requests surrounding that disaster.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I expect you have,&rdquo;
	Clay continued.  &ldquo;Arturo was a very advanced Sing.  His
	professional work lay in the area of complex systems replication. 
	Given that the Project is presumably looking to duplicate proven
	system prototypes, in order to expand exponentially the speed and
	capacity of its operations, I would be somewhat surprised if you
	didn't intend to recruit him at some point in the near future.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Most Paias, when confronted with
	such a supposition, would have activated a holoscreen or some other
	datapad device, in order to access the data stores necessary to
	confirm or deny it.  This one did not.  She merely raised an eyebrow
	and looked aside for a moment as she accessed the necessary data. 
	In only a few heartbeats she looked back at Clay.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I see that you are correct,
	Mr. Thorsten.  A contract offer was to be extended to him in a few
	days' time.  It is, naturally, contingent upon his availability.&rdquo;
	 Paia's eyes twinkled.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay smiled.  It seemed that this
	Paia was programmed for dessicated wit.  &ldquo;Then you will need
	to move him up the priority queue in order to avoid the contingency
	clause in his contract,&rdquo; he observed in an identical tone.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It would seem so.  I will
	certainly relay this information to my employer.  Now, on the
	subject of availability, a later phase of the Project will call for
	more public relations specialists, which is your own area of
	expertise.  I'm sure you can well imagine how that might be the
	case.  Your previous work for the Institute was satisfactory.  Can
	we count on your availability in, say, a month's time?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay did not have to feign a
	certain amount of surprise.  &ldquo;I might have to postpone taking
	some other work, but yes, I expect I could be available.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Excellent.&rdquo;  Paia
	stood up, and they understood their interview to be at an end.  They
	exchanged thank-yous, goodbyes, and handshakes with her and made
	their way out to the hallway.  As they walked back down the hall
	toward the zone point (an incongruous revolving door at the far end)
	Salma gave Clay's hand an excited squeeze.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That went perfectly,&rdquo;
	she observed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We made it past the
	gatekeeper,&rdquo; he agreed, with some relief evident in his voice.
	 &ldquo;She's going to tell Stefan.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And you got a job offer out
	of it, too.  How did you know that about the Institute planning to
	employ Art?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I didn't.  It was just a
	lucky guess, based on his background.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well I'm glad you bothered
	to look into his background.  She wouldn't have known, otherwise.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm not so sure about that,
	Salma.  I wouldn't underestimate the Paia of a Full Sing.  Hell,
	she's probably a lot smarter than we are.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma laughed as they stepped
	through the revolving door together.  They found themselves emerging
	in the lobby of a mountain lodge.   Its furnishings were rustic but
	comfortable, with lots of varnished wood and polished logs in
	evidence.  The room looked dim after the big glass-sided office. 
	The view outside was gorgeous: a sweeping valley rising to pine and
	fir clad slopes beyond, topped with purplish granite peaks still
	sparkling with snow in their highest cols even in deep summer.  A
	ticking clock on the wall in the shape of a sundial showed that it
	was quarter past ten.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma sighed happily and gave her
	boyfriend a hug.  &ldquo;We still have time to change and get down
	to the stables in time for the picnic trail ride up to the hanging
	lake,&rdquo; she said, gesturing at the clock.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yep, I'm there.&rdquo;  He
	put his arm around her and they headed down the carpeted corridor
	toward their suite.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara told me they have
	some of her riding outfits available here.  I'm going to try one
	on.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay laughed.  &ldquo;Okay, I'll
	do the same.  Always buy from friends.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm sorry
	it hasn't produced better results, so far.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm sorry too,&rdquo;
	Maxwell Cleary replied.  &ldquo;I know what you're going through.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The trace just hasn't shown
	anything special, no matter where I've gone.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The two men sat in the family room
	of the Cleary home, which was a large sprawling complex of buildings
	in rural northern Idaho.  Reverend Cleary's eyes looked a little
	weary behind his trademark glasses.  His tie was loosened and
	casually askew, and his hair was slightly mussed, probably from
	playing with the dogs in the yard earlier.  Outside the window, the
	winter night was coming down fast; it was too cold now for anyone to
	want to go outdoors again.  The Reverend had a fresh cup of piping
	hot cocoa on the walnut table in front of him, and he tasted it now
	and sighed pleasantly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The other man who sat facing him
	was considerably younger, and resembled him facially, but with dark
	brown hair rather than auburn.  He had a mug of hot tea before him,
	and took the opportunity to take a sip when the Reverend reached for
	his cocoa.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">None of the worlds I've
	visited seem to be using any particular common servers,&rdquo; the
	younger man continued, as they set their drinks back on their
	coasters.  &ldquo;Not even the special Sing world that's supposed to
	house the counterfeit copied souls.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What about unusual proxy
	routings?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That would have been
	noticed, due to the packet timings.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary looked decidedly
	uncomfortable.  &ldquo;So you've spent weeks immersed in blasphemous
	fake worlds, away from your proper life, separated from your home
	and family, in peril of your soul, and yet it has brought us no
	closer to an understanding of where the Sings are hosting their
	latest delusions.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I wouldn't go that far,
	sir,&rdquo; the other replied crisply.  &ldquo;We may have failed of
	our primary objective for the moment &ndash; though the analysts
	from Ferret claim that sometimes patterns eventually emerge once you
	have enough raw data.  Perhaps we just don't have enough, yet.  But
	I <I>have</I> made some progress on the personal contact front.  I
	think I may soon be in a position to actually meet one of these
	scanned and instanced simulacrums.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary's eyes narrowed, and after
	a moment he nodded.  &ldquo;If you can meet him on his own ground,
	that will help.  Then we'd know for sure that you were touching
	servers that have to be involved.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Exactly.  The Lord works in
	mysterious ways.  I believe that if we persevere, we will eventually
	find the information we need.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I pray nightly that we
	shall do so, and soon,&rdquo; Maxwell Cleary said gravely.  &ldquo;I'm
	very concerned about your having to do this.  When I think of the
	filth with which you've had to pollute your body to make this
	possible...&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I feel all right.  I don't
	think I've taken any lasting harm from it.  The nanites can be
	removed.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary shook his head.  &ldquo;Daniel,
	you are my son.  I'm concerned for you.  You of all people should be
	preserved from this technological contamination of the psyche.  It
	bothers me to see others, strangers, do it to themselves.  Still
	less you, who know better, who <I>are</I> better, than this.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I volunteered, father.  You
	accepted because you can trust my judgment.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The elder Cleary reached over and
	patted his son's wrist, then squeezed the back of his hand.  &ldquo;I
	know I can, Daniel.  I'm proud of you.  But you must make allowances
	for a father's fears.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel smiled.  &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Maxwell returned his son's smile
	for a moment, then moved on to his next topic.  &ldquo;Now, about
	this woman who is your primary contact, have you traced her?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No, not yet.  I'm hoping
	she'll volunteer the information on her identity and location freely
	at some point.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Good.  If she does, we can
	probably monitor her jack too, and double our effectiveness via the
	addition of another point of scan.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">For a moment, the Reverend's eyes
	seemed to focus a long way away.  &ldquo;Have you considered trying
	to contact her in reality?&rdquo; he asked at last.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not so far.  It isn't
	usually done, you know, with people you know only in virtuality. 
	But it might happen.  I think she, uh, genuinely cares about me.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Indeed?  And do you also
	care about her?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel Cleary shrugged.  &ldquo;She's
	a woman, father.  She's a real person, somewhere.  A basically good
	person, I think.  I don't suffer any illusions about her wanting to
	trade what we have in virtuality for a real life love affair, but
	someday, maybe, when I can tell her the truth and give her a chance
	to repent and come back to God, she'll entertain the idea.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And you would like that?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes.  She deserves better,
	father.  Everyone does, and she's helped me a lot.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well, if God wills it so,
	I've no doubt that her reward can be to be saved, when the rest are
	lost.  Just be sure that you do not desire her personal salvation
	too highly, for she may yet make the opposite choice.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I understand that, and I
	won't.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary sighed again, sipped some
	more cocoa, glanced out at the burgeoning night.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So when do you go back?&rdquo;
	he asked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Tomorrow.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A silence.  &ldquo;So soon.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It can't be helped.  I have
	scheduled commitments to keep.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">His father nodded.  &ldquo;So do
	we all.  I have to travel again myself tomorrow, to visit some of
	our brethren on the east coast.  Do you have everything you need?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Far as I know.  I'm sure
	mother won't be happy, though.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">How could she be?  A
	husband almost never home, and an eldest son who's gambling his life
	and his very soul for the cause by compromising with the Devil and
	his abominations.  Whenever I feel my motivation flagging, I have
	only to think of your mother and her sufferings, and I know at once
	that no one should have to endure such things, and that this is why
	we struggle.  Families are meant to live together, not to be rent
	apart by what they must do.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We'll be fine, father.  God
	will take care of us in this life, and our sacrifices will be
	rewarded by being together forever in the next.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The elder Cleary nodded.  &ldquo;I
	love you son, and want you to remember that the Order's future
	triumph will belong as much to our family as to anyone, I suppose.&rdquo;
	 He picked up his mug and abruptly finished his cocoa.   &ldquo;Except
	for the Lord of course,&rdquo; he amended with a flicker of a grin. 
	&ldquo;Daniel, will you come to the chapel and pray with me?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The younger man rose as his father
	did.  &ldquo;Of course, father.  I too will need strength for my
	journeys tomorrow.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Lord is our shepherd,
	we shall not want,&rdquo; said the Reverend fondly as he put his
	hand on his son's shoulder and walked beside him toward the chapel.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin,
	I've got something I want to show you.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin looked up from the system
	monitor he was studying and walked over to stand behind Stefan's
	chair.   Stefan was adjusting the display in the holo-monitor, which
	was showing the live feed from the Cronus Scanner.  Or one of the
	Scanners; there were now three of them in continuous operation.  The
	scene showed an earthen-filled dam, covered with snow, dim under the
	stars on a winter night.  At first Justin couldn't see anything of
	interest, and cast Stefan a quizzical sidelong look.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Let me zoom in some,&rdquo;
	Stefan said, and as he suited actions to words Justin saw some small
	dark figures moving around near the base of the dam, and a few more
	about halfway up the slope, operating some kind of machinery.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What the hell is that?&rdquo;
	Justin asked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You remember that dam that
	broke in B.C. in late December?  This is it, a couple of hours
	beforehand.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Oh yes, I remember hearing
	about that.  So what are these guys doing, repairs or sabotage?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The latter, I'm afraid. 
	They're drilling cores.  And if I'm not mistaken, they're putting
	plastic explosives down the holes.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin sat down in a chair next to
	his friend, and gave him his full attention.  &ldquo;Who the hell
	would be out in the freezing wilderness in the middle of the night,
	blowing up an old dam?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Who indeed?  Perhaps an
	even better question is why.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Somebody got tired of ice
	fishing?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Stefan had to smile.  &ldquo;Apart
	from all the fish, there were human casualties: the residents of a
	small cyber-immersion village a few miles downstream.  Forty-seven
	people, no survivors.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You think maybe someone was
	trying to kill one or more of those people?  Or were they
	incidental?  Anyone we know?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Stefan shrugged and zoomed in some
	more.  &ldquo;We've gotten a number of TDR requests for some of
	those forty-seven victims.  One of them was for a man named Arturo
	Scalleni.  We had a pending contract offer for him, to work on the
	Project.  When Paia told me about that I got curious, and decided to
	research the circumstances of his death.  I followed the wall of
	water back up to the dam break, then decided to see if I could find
	out what caused it to let go.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin looked concerned.  &ldquo;Can't
	fault you there, that is a bit suspicious.  But who would have known
	you were going to hire him?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well that's the point,
	nobody.  Scalleni hadn't even received our offer yet, and he's never
	worked for us before.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So why would anyone want to
	kill him?  I'm not following.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm not sure there's
	anything to follow.  Could be just a coincidence.  But the fact is,
	these guys here are sabotaging that dam so it will fail in the
	middle of the night.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin thought a moment.  &ldquo;These
	men here on the dam.  Can you tell if they're Moshes?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Stefan twiddled some controls
	experimentally, studied some numbers which streamed by on the edge
	of the holoscreen.  &ldquo;Well, there are no electromagnetic
	emissions to suggest embedded nanocomps in use in the area.  Doesn't
	prove someone doesn't have a neocortex that's just switched off. 
	But yeah, they could be Moshes.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The two Sings exchanged a glance. 
	&ldquo;The KOJ gang, perhaps?&rdquo; Justin mused.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Could be, Justin.  I
	suppose we might find out if we backtracked the personal history in
	time of some of these men.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Hmm.  Assuming some or all
	of them are members, why would the KOJ want to blow up this dam? 
	Seems like a pretty minor act of terrorism, doesn't it?  Why not
	something bigger, that couldn't be mistaken for a natural
	occurrence?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Indeed.  Besides, I thought
	the KOJ philosophy was all about God and country, law and order,
	that kind of thing.  Seems an unlikely bunch to commit terrorism or
	even random vandalism.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That, Stefan, may be sloppy
	thinking.  Sometimes your law-and-order types commit more mayhem
	than anybody.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">True.  So why do you think
	they did it?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm not sure yet.  What
	else was destroyed, apart from the immersion village and its
	inhabitants?  Anything else get hit downstream?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not really.  About five
	miles below the village the stream merges into the Fraser River. 
	Its flow was very low, given the temperature and the time of year. 
	The main river channel is wide at the confluence with the tributary,
	and it absorbed the additional water pretty easily.  A mile below
	the junction it scarcely even overflowed its banks.  Property damage
	further downstream was minor, with no loss of life.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So that suggests that the
	target must have been either the dam itself, or the village.  You
	said it was an immersion community.  What else?  Were they doing any
	hosting there?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Stefan rolled the Scanner back to
	some saved settings, replayed the destruction of the village by the
	wall of water and debris rolling down the narrow canyon, in slow
	motion.  The two men watched the signature flashes of fusion
	generators powering off as they were uprooted.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I count three fusion plants
	at least,&rdquo; Justin observed.  &ldquo;With one or two more
	possibly concealed under the leading edge of the water.  Only small
	units, but that's still some pretty substantial power capacity, way
	more than they'd need for those few buildings and fifty jacks.  They
	were hosting something,&rdquo; he concluded.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin spun his chair to another
	console, rapidly entered some cyberverse coordinates and access
	codes.  A network analysis system's control panel appeared.  He
	input the date and time of the village's destruction, gleaned from
	Stefan's frozen scanner display, along with the GPS coordinates.  A
	connectivity map appeared, showing the approximate position of any
	equipment that was transmitting packets which were part of the
	global mesh, with the nodes coded by spectrum proportional to the
	bandwidth being utilized.  Sure enough, the location of the village
	glowed a nice warm yellow, contrasting starkly with the near
	blackness of most of the surrounding remote area.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Stefan was now watching over
	Justin's shoulder.  &ldquo;Bingo,&rdquo; he said.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Uh-huh.  Perhaps the deaths
	were incidental, or at any rate anonymous.  It may have been
	whatever was being hosted there that was the target.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Any way to find out what
	that was?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm going to try,&rdquo;
	Justin said, continuing to access available data stores.  &ldquo;I'm
	now checking catalogs of virtualities open for business on that day,
	and cross referencing with closures, ones that went offline around
	that time.  Damn.  Seventy-five of them.  Well, it was the day after
	Christmas, so some of them were probably seasonal.  Okay, which ones
	had announced service termination in advance?  If I eliminate those,
	thirty-eight left.   I'm going to assume that service would likely
	not have been restored, even if they had a backup site, owing to the
	deaths of the operators.  Which leaves us twenty-three candidates. 
	And these two here I can eliminate because I'm familiar with them
	and know where they were hosted.  So we have twenty-one virtual
	worlds, some or all of which may have been hosted in that village.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The two men scanned the list.   No
	unifying characteristics were immediately apparent.  Content
	categories, pricing, payment methods, all pretty expectable.  No
	common marketing labels, although several were promoted by the same
	popular marketing firms, doubtless according to contract alongside
	thousands of other virtualities.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I see nothing here that
	would inflame the KOJ,&rdquo; Stefan concluded.  &ldquo;And how
	would they know what was hosted there anyway?  It's not like the
	Moshes are capable of doing the analysis you just pulled off.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Agreed, most Moshes aren't.
	 But some of their buddies in the North American Federation
	government might just be capable.   They aren't monitoring nearly as
	much of the mesh as they think, but they do monitor enough of it to
	deduce where some major sites are.  Maybe it's not so much what was
	being hosted at the village as the fact that anything at all was
	being hosted there.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The site's remote,&rdquo;
	Stefan agreed, thinking in tandem with Justin now.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And the method of its
	destruction could easily be put down to a natural disaster.  And
	probably would have been, had it not been for the Cronus Scanner.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Stefan grinned.  &ldquo;Yes, it <I>is</I>
	handy to be able to spy on your enemies this way, though that's
	hardly what we designed it for.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Still, what of it?  It's
	not like there's a handy lake poised above every brain house in the
	solar system.  If the KOJ is just trying to cause random cyberverse
	outages and disruptions, there are a lot bigger and better targets
	that they must be aware of.  So why start here?  And why not
	continue?  There haven't been any similar &ldquo;natural disasters&rdquo;
	before or since, have there?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Stefan shook his head.  &ldquo;Not
	that I could find.  It seems to be a one-off job.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin sighed.  &ldquo;I know it
	must seem like a waste of resources with only three Scanners
	operating, but I think you should backtrack one or two of those men
	at the dam.  Select whomever appeared to be in charge.  Find out who
	they are and where they came from, and if there are any more at home
	like them.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'll do that,&rdquo; Stefan
	replied.  &ldquo;And something else I'm going to do is bump Scalleni
	up the queue.  I want to interview him and find out if he knows any
	special reasons why radical Moshes would want to kill him or his
	neighbors.  Apart from which, I need to hire him!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Hell, do 'em all.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yeah, I think I will. 
	They're our folk, Justin.  They were all Sings, and they died to
	enemy action.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin twitched an eyebrow at the
	physicist.  &ldquo;Enemy action?  I appreciate the sentiment, but
	this isn't a war, yet.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I think it will be, soon. 
	This is an opening salvo of some kind, I can feel it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I hope you're wrong, but
	you could certainly be right.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That's why I need more
	Scanners running.  Which is precisely why I need Art Scalleni!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">How dare those KOJ rascals
	muck with your expansion plans!&rdquo; Justin exclaimed with mock
	indignation.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Damn right.  They'll rue
	the day.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin clapped his friend's
	shoulder in a comradely gesture as he rose and turned to go. 
	&ldquo;Thanks for letting me know, Stefan.  And now I have to go see
	a man about a terrorist.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Heh.  See ya.&rdquo; 
	Stefan turned back to his equipment as Justin zoned out.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Senator Robert C.
	Reynolds surveyed the setting in which he was to address the small
	crowd in a few more minutes.  An enormous long tent, like a circus
	pavilion, had been erected near the hilltop, with a platform built
	under one end of it.  The tent, surprisingly, was a hindrance today,
	and would serve only to prevent the attendees from standing in the
	uncharacteristically brilliant morning sunshine.  The temperature
	was brisk, but the calm, sunny conditions on this mid-January day
	had already persuaded him to unbutton his overcoat.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In the near distance, the towers
	of downtown Vancouver sparkled like a picture postcard from
	yesteryear.  Only a few streaks of high nimbus clouds in the far
	northwest, way out over the island, marred the otherwise cerulean
	sky.  The rich gladness of the day somehow felt hollow to Reynolds. 
	Days like this were unexpected diadems, treasures punctuating the
	grey tedium of damp, cloudy winters in the Pacific northwest.  The
	hollowness arose not just from the thinness of the crowd which he
	was about to address, but from his certain awareness of how few
	residents of this fair city would even witness the beauty of this
	day.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Then there was the irony that they
	were here to celebrate the inauguration of a new charity housing
	project, where the otherwise homeless and destitute could find
	shelter, sustenance, and community; but where every dwelling unit
	was, necessarily, equipped with live cyberverse jacks that would let
	the residents spend most of their time immersed in virtualities
	where they would never notice the anomaly of a sunny, cheerful
	winter's day in Vancouver.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Helping people was what made it
	all worthwhile to Reynolds.  Everything he did, all he had ever done
	in decades of public service, was dedicated to helping others. 
	Since the death of his wife, it had become the primary mechanism
	through which he expressed love and compassion.   He felt immensely
	grateful for every rich year he had had with Marguerite, but
	couldn't help feeling that his passion, and his happiness, had been
	a little selfish.  So as the years passed he had consciously tried
	to transmute that selfish passion into selfless service of others,
	into brotherly love for humanity, in an effort to pay something back
	for all the happiness he had once enjoyed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">To be sure, there were rewards. 
	Reynolds firmly believed that he who witnessed human suffering, and
	did not hasten to relieve it, was ignorant of the lesson that it was
	more blessed to give than to receive.  The conflict lay in the
	realization that, in some cases, giving people what they needed or
	craved in order to relieve their wants, might not be the best thing
	for them.  So what then?  Command them to do instead what you well
	knew would be best for them?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Senator Reynolds was painfully
	aware that those days of social engineering were over, that such was
	wishful thinking at best.  It might irk him that the majority of the
	people living in this part of the world would never notice today's
	gorgeous weather, or care about anything he did or said, or even
	what was happening in the real world in general, but what could he
	do about it?  He was vividly aware that virtuality delivered almost
	anything the mind could imagine.  This city's denizens could spend
	their time in a Vancouver where every day was like today.  They
	could travel anywhere that someone had imagined and created before
	them.  Or they could even imagine their own realities and offer them
	to others.  How on earth could &ldquo;real life&rdquo; compete with
	a world in which you could have anything you wanted, be anything you
	wanted, and be with anyone you wanted?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He had always detested the term
	&ldquo;meatspace&rdquo; &ndash; it was so derogatory.   Meat was
	stupid, meat was food, and when uncooked it was gooey and gelatinous
	and disgusting.  For eons humans had been living, breathing,
	thinking, feeling flesh; but Reynolds felt no disgust at being
	biological, despite its limitations.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not that certain biological
	improvements weren't useful, even necessary, for most people.  The
	genes he had inherited from his birth parents had revealed some
	alarming flaws when he'd had his genome mapped back when.  He'd
	possessed disturbing predispositions toward both cancer and
	congestive heart failure.  Somatic gene therapy had corrected that
	of course, just as it had arrested his natural progression toward
	his chronological age of sixty-three.  But he had never wanted to go
	whole hog with a nanobot neocortex, respirocites, a GI-tract
	replacement, skeleto-muscular augmentation, and &ldquo;upgrades&rdquo;
	to his other important organs.  He was content spending his life as
	a Mosh in this so-called, much-reviled meatspace.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This was, unfortunately, a
	minority opinion these days.  Already there were critical labor
	shortages in almost every field from nanomedicine to gardening. 
	Even most of the people who still had jobs in meatspace kept them
	merely to earn money they could spend in the cyberverse.  Indeed,
	cyberverse currencies were widely used to pay for goods and services
	in meatspace, because both parties knew that they could exchange
	those credits anytime to almost anyone, whether or not they
	themselves ever visited the particular cyberverse worlds where those
	currencies originated and had value.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A year or so ago, Justin Turrell
	had sent Reynolds an economic study produced by one of his Sing
	colleagues, which analyzed relative labor costs in both the
	cyberverse and meatspace, and explored the ways in which prices in
	one influenced prices in the other.  The study opined that labor
	scarcity in meatspace would raise the price of labor there so much
	that people would actually be drawn back to jobs in meatspace,
	because they could make so much more so very quickly.  This would
	remain true until innovation discovered ways to perform the required
	meatspace tasks through artificial intelligence or robotics more
	cheaply than humans could do them, at which point the jobs &ndash;
	and the workers &ndash; would vanish back into the cyberverse.  In
	the end, the study projected, after numerous oscillations back and
	forth, ninety-nine percent of everything in the physical world would
	be automated and all but a tiny remnant of human labor and
	intellectual capital would forever be deployed in virtuality.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That seemed like a way of saying
	that everyone was destined to become Sings, and that this was a good
	thing.  But he, Robert Reynolds, had seen the &ldquo;invisible hand&rdquo;
	fail altogether too many times in his lifetime.  Why, even this
	dedication today was proof of it.  Why should thousands of human
	beings, either unwilling or unable to find a niche in meatspace, end
	up as wards of the state, if the system was perfectly balanced in
	some sort of market equilibrium?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There were, he knew, more radical
	voices within the Mosh community who absolutely loathed and resented
	this trend of humanity gradually vanishing into worlds of its own
	creation.  Those voices frightened and pained him.  If he was sure
	of anything, it was that you couldn't force billions of people to do
	what you wanted against their will, and that if you even tried, the
	result would be horror beyond imagining.   He wanted nothing to do
	with mass violence, and when you came right down to it, that was the
	only tool that government had available to do anything to change
	human behavior on such a scale.   Whenever persuasion was useless,
	force became the only resort.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds' belief in democracy, as
	the basic underpinning of state power, prevented him from being able
	to accept the proposals of the Mosh reactionaries within the
	Federation.  He may not like it, but the fact was that in choosing
	not to be around to witness this bright, fine day, the silent
	majority had cast their votes for the worlds they preferred over the
	one world that he preferred.  So as a good public servant, he had
	his marching orders, and they did not include giving government
	approval and support to what amounted to a holy war to turn back the
	calendar.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The senator sighed and checked his
	chronometer.  Almost time.  He started moving toward the pavilion. 
	Peter and his other aides fell into step beside him.  As they
	entered the big tent, they were noticed by the crowd milling around
	near the front, who began to take their seats.   Some smiled and
	waved.  Reynolds was careful to make a point of stopping to greet
	anyone whom he recognized, or who looked earnest about shaking his
	hand and saying hello.   Picture of a politician pressing the flesh
	at a public appearance, as old as time.  The greetings and
	introductions passed over him in a blur of phatic utterance.  An
	aide was discreetly recording everything using an implanted
	experience recorder, so he made no real effort to remember the
	specifics of what anybody said.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Once they had reached the front,
	one of the organizers jumped up to the podium and asked everyone to
	be seated.  Then after a brief and respectful introduction, it was
	Reynolds' turn to hand off his overcoat and ascend the podium to a
	smattering of applause.  Once there he paused for a moment to scan
	the audience before him.  There were some sixty or seventy persons
	present, less than a third of what the tent could have sheltered. 
	Quite a few of them were local government workers, or part of the
	work crews that had assembled the prefabricated housing units now
	standing on the far slopes behind them.  The rest were probably
	prospective inmates of the project, with a few additions who might
	have been out walking or something and just happened by to find out
	what was going on.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He supposed the old lady in the
	front row might be one of the latter.  There were those people who
	chose not to embrace modern technology, who consciously preferred to
	go on living as they were, without even taking advantage of life
	extension science, though at the peril of their lives.  Such
	individuals were increasingly desperate to maintain normal human
	contacts and relationships.  For the true Moshes, the real world was
	becoming an ever more lonely place.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">For a moment Reynolds wanted to
	walk off the stage, say to hell with it, and go straight to the
	nearest nanoclinic and order a top-of-the-line nanocomp neocortex
	installed in his head.  He didn't have any cyberverse currency, but
	the clinics still took ameros last he heard, and he had plenty of
	them.  Then he could do like his Sing constituents and go fishing,
	like he had with his granddad in Manitoba back when he was a boy. 
	Screw meatspace and politics; if you can't beat 'em join 'em.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But he knew that he couldn't do
	that.  What <I>he</I> needed at the moment was beside the point. 
	That wasn't service to others.  There were people here who were
	counting on him to do things.  He made himself smile at the old
	woman, though she made him want to weep.  She beamed back at him,
	intent on whatever he meant to say.  Most of the rest of them looked
	mildly interested, tolerant, or bored.  A more phlegmatic audience
	he could hardly have wished for.  All right then.  He would talk to
	her.  And to anyone who might bother to tune in to whatever
	meshcasts would be making his remarks available in virtuality.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Since the early days of
	representative government, it has been the duty of those in public
	service to provide for the public welfare,&rdquo; he began.  &ldquo;A
	social safety net has consistently provided housing, medicine, and
	sustenance of last resort for those who had no other refuge.  I'm
	pleased to be able to announce that the North American Federation is
	still actively providing that network of support, and that the
	rumors which you may have heard about the demise of government in
	our time have been greatly exaggerated.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Scattered applause greeted this
	opening witticism, and the senator dropped his eyes to his prepared
	text in front of him.  It was all there: the details about the new
	housing project, the kudos and plaudits to the donors and builders,
	the wise words about the importance of charity toward one's fellow
	man, the usual pious hopes about folks moving out of the project
	instead of becoming permanent dependents, even some well-placed
	barbs impugning the motives of those who categorically resisted the
	idea of enforcing the tax laws to give government expanded
	resources.  With the practiced ease of a man with decades of public
	speaking experience, Reynolds read his speech text in his loud,
	friendly, thoughtful voice, while only seeming to glance down
	occasionally.  He didn't need to think.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But in the back of his mind he was
	nagged by worries.   Worries about the radicals in the clergy, hell,
	even in his own government, and what they might someday try to do. 
	Worry about what the Sings might do in response.  He counted Justin
	as a friend, but in a way the man terrified him.  What would a
	super-intelligence do if attacked?  Engineer a killer virus to wipe
	out all the unaltered humans?  If this Last Trumpet business didn't
	light the fires, how long would it be until the cyber portion of
	humanity did something that inevitably would?   And even if nobody
	on either side did anything dramatic, how long would human life as
	he had known it continue?  What had the last twenty years been but
	the long, slow death of human culture and community in the four
	dimensions of real space and time?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The needless pavilion that
	concealed the assembly from the bright day outside suddenly struck
	him as symbolic.  Like the cyberverse, it was constructed by man,
	and cast a shroud over them which separated them from the open sky,
	whether grey or blue.  But the metaphor failed as soon as he
	recalled that one could easily walk out from under this tent, as
	they all would once he had finished speaking.  He did not think that
	humanity would ever manage to walk out of the cyberverse.  Not even
	if someone somehow blew the whole damn thing up.   The great mass of
	people would emerge from their virtual immersion, doubtless
	incredibly piqued, and just build the entire thing all over again. 
	Probably after angrily stomping the bombers into dusty red goo.  You
	would have to eradicate the ideas, and Reynolds knew painfully well
	that one cannot kill an idea.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As he concluded his speech, he
	felt like a mere simulacrum of a man, like a puppet delivering an
	oration for an unseen ventriloquist.  When Justin donned his garb of
	flesh and came to visit his office, was he a simulation of a human
	being?  Or were people like Justin the real thing on some higher
	level, and it was the Moshes who were simulations, or perhaps
	atavisms, of what humans <I>could</I> be?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Some people cynically supposed
	that the entire universe might be a simulation, running on somebody
	else's vast computer.   It was almost enough to make a guy become
	religious.  But in his view that was the ultimate cop-out, turning
	your destiny over to some supernatural being whose motives you
	couldn't possibly understand, whose very existence you could never
	even prove.  Becoming a &ldquo;believer&rdquo; would be even worse
	than just walking away and becoming a Sing.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Applause, some of it actually
	sounding heartfelt, brought him back to himself as he finished his
	speech.  He grinned and waved to acknowledge the reception, then
	stepped off the platform to shake some more hands and do some more
	mingling.  He still had a few minutes before his aides would whisk
	him away to his next event, a luncheon with some of the party
	faithful.  Reynolds made an effort to enjoy himself, to take
	pleasure in his job, to push back his concerns about the future. 
	That too was a thing you got good at, after a while.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif"><FONT SIZE=4>A Peculiar
	Installation</FONT></FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This had to be
	the weirdest installation he had ever done, Taylor McGivens
	reflected.  In more than five years of working for Petrovmesh, he'd
	never seen anything like this.  The location was remote, some ten
	miles outside the nearest town, which was Esker, Labrador.  In the
	middle of January, for Chrissake.  He'd flown in on an aircar,
	equipped for cargo and rigged for stealth.  That in itself wasn't
	unusual; plenty of Petrovmesh's brain houses were in remote places
	and got set up in secret.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">His cargo <I>was</I> unusual. 
	Here were none of the latest systems which the company usually
	deployed, which its business in fact relied upon, given the
	extraordinary quality of the virtualities which were dreamed up by
	Petrov, its founding genius.  When Taylor opened the crates and
	started moving the systems in here, he found nothing but
	last-generation CPUs and storage arrays, at least five years old. 
	Stuff the company should have retired already.  And this was all
	going into a <I>new</I> site?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The prefab dome was pretty
	standard, with the usual power generation and remote security
	features.  Its construction was recent, and looked to have been
	rather perfunctory, but it was functional.  The only odd thing about
	it was that the hydrogen cells were stocked with only enough fuel to
	keep the fusion generator running for about six months.  After that,
	someone would have to come out and service the site in order to keep
	it operating.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So maybe the site was temporary,
	and only intended to run for a short time?  After which it would get
	upgraded?  But then why shove these crappy old systems out here in
	the first place?  Why not just start out with new?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And then there were the fee
	settings.  Taylor had already brought up the power and booted all
	the hardware.  Now he was consulting the configuration data which
	he'd been provided.  He gaped in disbelief at what the palmtop
	holo-pad was telling him.  These prices were flat out ridiculous. 
	Nobody was going to pay rates like these to access CPU cycles this
	slow.  This had to be at least three times the rate that would get
	any action these days, even at peak times for overflow demand. 
	Could two shipments have gotten mixed up, and somebody thought they
	were installing new hardware here, but the old shit got sent
	instead?  If so, that would mean that the new gear was probably
	headed for the recycle bin.  He ought to ask when he got back to the
	office.  Shaking his head, Taylor keyed in the specified rate
	settings anyway.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Next he brought up the external
	network interface.   Like most cyberverse hosts, this cluster was
	running DR.OS, the Distributed Resources Operating System, once upon
	a time the brain child of one Justin Turrell.  Like other open
	source software systems before it, DR.OS had been added to and
	extended by countless others since.  Its core protocols, however,
	were still relied upon to weld the cyberverse together into a single
	vast community of nodes.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As the external wireless net came
	up, it began pinging heuristically chosen frequencies, looking for
	other nodes with which it could exchange data.  Whenever one
	answered, this cluster would transmit a list of the processor,
	storage, and network bandwidth resources which it presently had
	available, along with the corresponding micropayment fees it charged
	for the metered use of each.  The answering system would respond
	with its own capability and price list, which would be recorded by
	the local network AI, along with the transmission frequency, signal
	strength, and round-trip transmission time of the other node. 
	Thereafter the two systems would keep each other posted at intervals
	concerning changes in their available capacities and rates.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Over time, the network's AI would
	build up a picture, something like a radar screen, of the other
	nodes reasonably close to it in terms of light-seconds of
	transmission time.  Whenever a connected user or a running client
	program wanted more of some resource than its local host could
	provide, the network map was consulted, and the best-fitting
	neighbor system was selected.  An offer was made for its resources,
	subject to any price limitations set by the end user.  If the offer
	was accepted, the AI would subcontract the neighbor node to fulfill
	the demand.  If the second node in turn became fully utilized, or
	stepped up its rates, the next cheapest node would be contacted, and
	so on.  Nodes could also pass off requests which they could not
	themselves satisfy, by referring the bidders to their own known
	neighbors, thus harnessing the power of recursion and earning
	themselves referral fees.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">DR.OS was designed as a
	self-extending network, which automatically shunted demand, like
	water seeking the lowest point, onto the most cost-effective service
	providers offering the best available price-performance ratios. 
	Almost everyone's cyberverse jacks and home systems had at least
	some spare capacity sometimes, which meant that every consumer was
	also potentially a producer &ndash; if the price was right. 
	Justin's genius had been to develop a massively parallel networking
	protocol that seamlessly integrated the economic aspects with the
	technical ones.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The prices he was entering, Taylor
	knew, were just not workable.  Even to be a broker node that earned
	mainly referral fees, you had to have your rates set low enough so
	that someone would ask you for anything in the first place.  Broker
	nodes typically had low prices along with low capacities, but a
	densely populated network neighbor map.  This cluster he was
	bringing online had high prices and small capacity, and let's face
	it, out here in the middle of frozen nowhere its close neighbor list
	was going to be comparatively short.  Response time didn't matter so
	much for data storage access, but for reselling CPU cycles and
	network bandwidth, even milliseconds of extra transmission time
	counted.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Bottom line: why was his employer
	asking him to set up a brain house that was guaranteed to be a loss
	leader?  As far as he knew, Petrovmesh had always made a tidy
	profit.  Certainly he himself had always been paid well, and on
	time.  This facility would never repay its own installation costs,
	so what was the point?  Privacy?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There had to be something else
	behind this.  But if it wasn't just a simple mistake, he was very
	unlikely to find out what it was.  Nothing to do but make sure
	everything was working nominally.  Or as nominal as equipment this
	old could be expected to work.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In less than an hour's time,
	Taylor was satisfied that no further adjustments were required that
	could not be done remotely using the proper access codes.  So he
	started up the secure remote console service, and double-checked the
	environmental and building security settings.  Then he packed up his
	tools, locked up, and bundled his gear back into the aircar.  The
	sun was setting in the southwest, pale and watery on the horizon as
	this short northern winter day ebbed.  The temperature was dropping
	already, making him glad of his heated thermal work suit.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He swung up into the cabin and
	sealed the door.  As he took his seat he gave instructions to the
	pilot AI.  &ldquo;Power up for flight mode.  Enter GPS coordinates
	for company depot number 36.  Equip stealth flight mode.  Confirm
	readiness wi' computed arrival time.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">After a minute or two of whirring
	and revving and preflight systems testing, the AI replied
	conversationally: &ldquo;Arrival in D plus four hours, seventeen
	minutes.  Initiating takeoff on command.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Depot 36, Taylor knew, was in
	Hungary, so that would put his arrival at after midnight local time.
	And goodness knows where they'd send him tomorrow.  &ldquo;Commence
	flight operations,&rdquo; he confirmed, and the aircar obediently
	launched itself into the evening sky.   Taylor settled the seat into
	a supine position.  He had four hours to kill; might as well try to
	get some Zs.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The enemy horde
	marched out of the distant horizon, first discernible as a faint
	cloud of dust.    As it drew closer, swarming individual shapes
	could be distinguished.  Alarm horns rang out from the white marble
	top of the citadel, which blushed pink in the unfolding dawn.  As
	the sun rose slowly in the east, it glinted off the approaching
	enemy formations.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana stood impassively in an
	east-facing archway on a balcony near the top of the citadel.  Her
	silken black hair was bound off her face by a silver headpiece
	bearing a translucent gem in the center of her forehead.  Her jade
	green robes rustled slightly in the morning breeze, her hands tucked
	into the voluminous sleeves, her feet concealed by the rippling fall
	of silk.  Were it not for the faint motion of her hair and clothes,
	she might have been a statue mounted on the balcony.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A movement behind her did not
	immediately divert her attention from the distant spectacle of the
	incoming invaders.  Justin paced the floor behind her and emerged at
	her side.  He was garbed in vestments of a dark red, just a few
	shades lighter than blood, with a gold headpiece bearing a clear gem
	closely resembling Riksana's.  He carried a tall staff with an
	ornamented top made of some light, malleable metal wrought in the
	likeness of a small raven poised for flight.  He gazed outward for a
	minute or so, as motionless as his companion.  Then he spoke.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Twelve thousand, do you
	think?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">At least,&rdquo; Riksana
	replied after a moment.  &ldquo;And they have some heavy siege
	engines and no small amount of supporting firepower.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We have enough troops here
	to man the walls fully, plus our own siege turrets.  Unless they can
	breach our walls, it shouldn't be a problem.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As long as the walls hold,
	yes.  But I'm sure they know that too, so I expect they must have
	some plan in that regard.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We'll just have to wait and
	see.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana nodded.  Justin turned
	back inside and walked over to an obelisk in the center of the
	chamber.  Inscribed on its side was a rough map of the keep.  He
	reached out and touched the representation of the outer gatehouse,
	and then abruptly was gone.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Appearing on the gatehouse, Justin
	found the Castellan deploying his forces on the walls, shouting
	instructions to the quartermasters concerning what type of ammo to
	break out for the catapults.  He gave the Castellan a comradely
	smile, and waited for him to finish giving out his orders.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Nice to see you again,
	Elungus,&rdquo; Justin said as the man turned to face him and offer
	a salute, which he returned.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And you, sir,&rdquo; the
	Castellan replied.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Like Justin and Riksana, Castellan
	Elungus was a PC, a player character controlled by a human rather
	than by an AI.   Like them, he was a longtime participant in this
	medieval simulation, which was called Dark Age Ascending and had now
	been running continuously for almost twenty years.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The virtual world was called
	Palandria, and there were two main factions which struggled for
	supremacy over its continents, its oceans and archipelagos, and even
	over the Underearth beneath its surface: the Northeastern Alliance,
	and the Corivites.  This fortress, the Keep of Torlane, belonged to
	the Alliance and guarded the narrow Isthmus of Dracia.   The
	approaching horde owed its allegiance to the Corivites, who wanted
	to seize the fortress in order to ease the way for future strikes
	deep into Dracia.  The sub-continent of Dracia had been secured by
	the armies of the Alliance more than five years ago.  The loss of
	Torlane could lead to a renewed battle for Dracia, which was an
	important province owing to both its agricultural output and its
	mineral wealth.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Today's events in Palandria were
	not, as the saying went, canonical.  They were based on the
	circumstances and available forces which had existed at the time
	that the virtual world's databases had been imaged and copied.  But
	since that snapshot was taken a few days ago, the actual history of
	Palandria had continued to unfold within the mainline simulation,
	based on the actions and decisions of the players and AIs who'd been
	participating.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Before zoning into this Palandria
	instance, Justin had paused to review the current status in the
	canonical instance.  As actual history went, the Corivite forces had
	<I>not</I> attacked the Keep of Torlane, but instead had mounted an
	amphibious raid more than a hundred miles down the coast &ndash;
	which had been repulsed.  Today's engagement was the result of
	divergent decisions, probably initiated by AIs filling in for absent
	PCs on the Corivite side of things.  It was therefore impossible to
	know just how it was going to turn out today: something which
	invariably pleased him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The purpose of this non-canonical
	simulation, or mod, was to beta test some new hosting hardware.  Not
	only were the systems which were running this parallel instance of
	Palandria the best and fastest available, but they were physically
	located on the Moon.  This fact, together with the almost three
	light-second average round trip packet response time from Earth,
	necessarily required that all of the PCs upload themselves to
	lunar-based systems, so that they could avoid the lag by interfacing
	with Palandria directly on the local lunar network.  For the Full
	Sings, such as Justin and Riksana, this was simple enough to do. 
	They merely backed themselves up on Earth-based storage devices,
	then uploaded themselves to the lunar systems.  The process was not
	unlike that which had been performed with Palandria itself, by
	forking off a modified instance &ndash; but with the difference that
	both instances did not run simultaneously.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In theory any Full Sing could
	effectively clone themselves in this way, allowing multiple
	instances of themselves to exist in parallel, but in practice this
	was not done.  There were a host of ethical, legal, and
	psychological issues which arose to make the practice highly
	undesirable.  When today's test was over, the data transmission
	would be reversed to update each individual's Earth copy with the
	experience memory of the lunar copy, after which the actively
	running instance would be switched back to Earth.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">However not all of the players
	participating today were Full Sings.  A significant percentage were
	biological Sings.  For these people, a fresh technique was being
	employed to avoid transmission lag, which was also undergoing some
	rigorous testing today.  Those parts of their mindfiles which were
	readily copyable, especially their knowledge and memories of Dark
	Age Ascending and the characters that they played, were scanned and
	converted to portable digital form, then beamed up to the Moon and
	hosted on the lunar network.   Meanwhile their biological brains and
	bodies were put into a state resembling dream sleep.   The lunar
	copies of their consciousness directed the actions of their
	characters in Palandria just as they normally would, and their
	real-time experiences in the simulation were buffered up and beamed
	back to Earth.  These were then fed passively into their senses,
	albeit lagged by the transmission delay.  In this way their skills
	and personality could locally control what they were doing in
	Palandria in real time, yet their somnolent awareness back on Earth
	wouldn't miss a moment of the action.  It was a bit like becoming a
	Full Sing for a day.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The idea was that all players
	could share equally in the virtuality, even though it wasn't local
	to the Earth.  The perfection of these techniques had potentially
	far-reaching consequences for the expansion of the cyberverse.  Only
	a subset of the player base was taking part in the lunar mod; most
	of them were still using the main canonical instance.  Dark Age
	Ascending's mesh tribe numbered just over a million people who zoned
	into it regularly.   Some, like Justin and Riksana, though they had
	not spent much time in it recently, had been a part of its history
	since the very early days nearly two decades ago.  About twenty
	thousand PCs were presently zoned into today's lunar mod test: not
	much of a load, but enough to generate some useful feedback on the
	new systems.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Standing on top of the gatehouse
	with Castellan Elungus, Justin could now perceive formations of
	Corivite war chariots sweeping around in front of their infantry in
	wide spiral arcs.   Much slower wagons carried siege engines and
	ammunition in the rear lines.  Still, they would be here soon.  They
	would encounter no resistance until they arrived at the keep,
	because the Alliance had nobody outside the fortress in the field.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin stood with his staff
	planted in front of him, hands clasped just below its ornamental
	raven, eyes closed, whispering in a language unique to Palandria. 
	The full knowledge of that language had taken him countless play
	sessions spread over a decade to win, once upon a time.   As the
	enemy drew closer, Riksana ported down to join them and stood
	nearby, making some silent preparations of her own.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Elungus looked from one to the
	other and grinned.  &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with a
	fully manned keep and you two both here, I really don't think these
	guys have much of a chance.  They should have brought fifty
	thousand, not fifteen.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana laughed lightly, and
	bestowed on Elungus an uncharacteristically warm smile that lit her
	habitually calm face almost like a flashbulb going off.  &ldquo;Of
	course, we could be a little rusty,&rdquo; she demurred.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Rusty, hell.  Even without
	adventuring much lately, you're still among the top ten Alliance
	mages in Palandrian history.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well then, let's hope the
	other side doesn't bring out their top ten too,&rdquo; she said with
	mock concern.   &ldquo;You about done, Justin?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin broke off his
	unintelligible muttering and opened his eyes.  &ldquo;Just about.  
	I've laid a few traps a ways outside archery range.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana raised an eyebrow at him. 
	&ldquo;And you've reinforced the walls and gate?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Naturally.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">See?  I told you you're not
	rusty,&rdquo; the Castellan said, and turned to tell his aides to
	break out the signal flags and confirm preparedness status at all
	the defensive positions around the fortress.  A  minute of rapid
	semaphore elicited the desired answer: all was in readiness.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Corivite charioteers held
	their formations as they wheeled in front of the keep.  There were
	perhaps five hundred chariots moving in three separate wedges,
	spiraling closer and closer but taking care to remain out of bowshot
	from the walls.  At a moment when two of the groups were circling
	inward to run parallel to the walls, Justin raised his arms and
	spoke a loud, commanding phrase.  The ground over which the chariots
	were running abruptly heaved and buckled, forming a cross-grained
	pattern of ridges and troughs at irregular intervals.  Chariots
	bounced and collided and even overturned, and no small number of
	riders (each chariot had several) were thrown off before they could
	brake to a stop.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin cried aloud again, and in
	all the troughs and low places, short, stubby four-pawed creatures
	formed that appeared to be made of earth and fire.  These
	immediately set upon the discomfited charioteers and their horses. 
	The third chariot group drew rein at a safe distance and blew horns
	signaling a retreat.  The men under attack broke off their desperate
	close-quarters melee at once and fled toward their allies.  The
	earth creatures pursued, but more slowly.  As soon as some space
	opened up between the fleeing troops and their inhuman pursuers,
	huge incorporeal hammers appeared over the earth creatures and swung
	earthward, hinged on the wind.  The silently pursuing conjurations
	were quickly pounded into dust and disintegrated.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Now that was nasty,&rdquo;
	Elungus said admiringly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It's what they get for
	bringing chariots to a castle siege,&rdquo; Justin replied levelly. 
	&ldquo;It does prove they have some heavy magical support of their
	own on hand, though.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Which is no more than we
	expected,&rdquo; said Riksana calmly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Now painfully aware that Torlane
	had high-order mages among its defenders, the enemy host took its
	time getting organized until they could advance in echelon alongside
	their siege towers and slowly creeping mobile catapults.  The
	salvageable chariots and horses were recovered, after their own
	mages checked the area for further booby traps.  Their catapults
	ranged the walls by firing canisters of some explosive liquid fire,
	which did no damage to the thirty foot parapets but were evidently
	intended to force defenders away from their positions.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Finally the Corivite troops moved
	inside arrow range, forming turtles with their overlapping shields
	surrounding each advancing siege engine.  One of the bigger groups
	escorted a large battle ram toward the gate.  Castellan Elungus gave
	the order to open fire on the enemy siege engines.  Ballistae and
	palintones emplaced along the walls began to speed steel shafts
	toward the enemy ram and catapults.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana flung out her arms in a
	summoning gesture, and a thin, twisting cloud of jade mist formed
	along the circuit of the walls, a dozen yards out.  Whenever a
	friendly projectile passed through it, the arrow or bolt flickered
	with green light as though picking up a tiny piece of the mist. 
	When they struck their targets, green flames flared and spread like
	burning naphtha, eating into metal, wood, and flesh.  Corivite
	wizards rapidly extinguished the flames, but they could not be
	everywhere at once, and several of the turtles were shattered and
	forced to retreat, including the one guarding the battle ram.  The
	ram itself caught fire and burned where it stood abandoned.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Excellent,&rdquo; Elungus
	said with a slight bow to Riksana.  &ldquo;But why are they
	continuing to move their catapults closer?  They have range to the
	walls already.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Either they want to shoot
	at something behind the wall, or they intend to fire some shot with
	shorter range,&rdquo; Justin offered.  Riksana's eyes narrowed at
	the latter possibility.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sure enough, the cats stopped
	their advance in a few more yards, then commenced firing a new type
	of ammunition.  This resembled a sparkling ball of ice, which broke
	apart shortly before it thudded against the walls, so that the stone
	surface was pelted with a cloud of dusty frost.  The material stuck
	to the wall momentarily like an impacted snowball.  Then it hissed
	and sparkled and fell away to the ground.  The area of impact was
	left scored and eaten away as if by some incredibly corrosive acid.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I've never seen anything
	quite like that,&rdquo; Justin commented.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Your wall-hardening spell
	isn't stopping it,&rdquo; Elungus noted.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No.  Slowing it down some
	maybe, but that's all.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Concentrate on taking out
	the cats while I research a solution,&rdquo; Riksana suggested.  She
	turned away and descended a spiral stair which led into the
	courtyard behind the walls, so she could go stand near where they
	were being damaged.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Castellan Elungus shouted for more
	ballista fire to be directed at the catapults that were hurling the
	ice balls, and his semaphore team on the roof above passed the order
	around the keep.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin stepped up into a crenel on
	the wall and conjured a couple of fire giants: ugly, heavily-armored
	brutes twenty feet tall wielding huge flaming hammers.  They charged
	one of the catapults, forcing its crew to back off and defend
	themselves, and drawing the hostile attentions of their supporting
	magicians.  While they were busy, he summoned up two more and
	dispatched them against another catapult.  As each pair of giants
	began to get overwhelmed by the catapult defenders and the enemy
	wizards, Justin would pull them back to the wall, heal them up as
	best he could, and then send them out again to attack a different
	catapult.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Between the storm of missiles
	lashing out from around the keep, augmented by Riksana's jade aura
	effect, and the efforts of Alliance bowmen and the fire giants, all
	of the catapults were eventually abandoned by the enemy and
	destroyed.  Corivite casualties littered the ground around their
	burning remains.   Though the keep walls had not yet been breached,
	several sections had sustained very heavy damage and were plainly
	much weakened.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As the enemy withdrew and
	regrouped, it appeared for a moment that they might give up the
	attack.  But then large trebuchets much further back in their lines
	began firing on the damaged sections, hurling lead balls a yard in
	diameter which exploded on impact.  Ordinarily a keep like Torlane
	could withstand such a bombardment for days, but with the structural
	integrity of its walls undermined, the outcome was unclear. 
	Naturally Justin and the other Alliance mages in the defense force
	did what they could to shore up the ramparts and weaken or divert
	the incoming trebuchet shots.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They were successful enough that
	as the sun climbed up the sky, the enemy grew impatient.  A fresh
	contingent of short-range catapults was assembled and began
	advancing toward the walls again.  In addition, the main body of
	their infantry approached, bearing ladders and grappling hooks to
	scale the walls.  Another ram could be seen moving toward the gate
	behind a screen of knights carrying mantlets.  The idea seemed to be
	to force the defenders to pay a high price if they elected to
	concentrate all their efforts on the catapults a second time.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Our walls won't survive a
	second round of fire from these new catapults,&rdquo; Elungus
	concluded.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin nodded.  &ldquo;I'll go
	find out how Riksana's doing.&rdquo;  He waved all four giants over
	to the main gate, ready to greet the knights incoming with their
	ram.  Sending them out at the catapults, with so many men around
	them, would simply get the giants killed to little purpose.  But
	being creatures of fire, they would not be harmed by the boiling oil
	which the garrison would shortly be pouring down on the ram and its
	crew, and hence they could attack the rammers with relative
	impunity.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin descended into the
	courtyard, and found Riksana standing against the inside of the wall
	right behind one of the most damaged sections, with her hands
	pressed flat against its surface.  The thudding vibrations of the
	bombardment hitting the far side could be felt even without direct
	contact.   The air behind the wall boomed with a kind of shock wave.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You going to hold that
	thing up if it falls down?&rdquo; he asked, which was almost what it
	looked like she was attempting.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Funny man,&rdquo; she
	replied.  After a moment, she mused, &ldquo;The atomic structure is
	being undermined.  It's not a chemical effect, like an acid,
	weakening the molecular bonds of the stone.  It's an energy effect,
	which is quite literally disrupting the nuclear binding forces and
	electron shell states of the constituent atoms themselves.  The
	elements simply don't fit together anymore, so the molecules break
	apart.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That's bizarre.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes.  I haven't yet figured
	out a counterspell.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Um.  Well, we're beginning
	to run out of time.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I was afraid of that.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin wasn't sure what to
	suggest.  Riksana was one of the preeminent Mattermancers in
	Palandria, and knew vastly more about the ways magical energy and
	matter could affect one another than he did.   Still...</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It looks like an ice ball
	visually, but what you're describing sounds more like a heat
	transfer effect.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She shot him a look.  &ldquo;Yes,
	in a way.  Destructive energy permeating the outer layer of
	material, spreading inwards and petering out as it reaches cooler,
	unaffected layers.&rdquo;  She paused, pondering.  &ldquo;Heat
	transfer through a medium is impeded if the material is initially
	very cold.  So if I&ndash;&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Immobilize the molecules,&rdquo;
	Justin said together with her at the same moment.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The motion of the molecules
	is circulating them through the unbinding energy.  What I need is
	stasis, or nearly complete stasis.  Make the energy expend itself
	trying to force the wall molecules to move.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Something like a heat sink.
	 You got a spell for absolute zero?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana had to smile at Justin's
	hyperbole.  &ldquo;No, actually.  But an energy transmutation of
	very cold, very dense material between the wall and the attacking
	energy should work just as well.&rdquo;  She dropped her hands to
	her sides and considered that proposition earnestly, her head tilted
	to one side, eyes unfocused.  The physical laws of this virtuality,
	which permitted magic, were much different than those of real space,
	but no less exacting and precise, and Riksana understood them as
	well as anyone did.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin left her to work it out,
	having contributed what he could, and returned to the gatehouse
	wall.  Thanks to his fire giants, the enemy was making no real
	progress on the gate, but putting a lot of stress on the keep and
	its garrison overall.  He restored one of the giants that was badly
	wounded, and helped out where he could, hurling firebolts and clouds
	of noxious fumes at clumps of nearby enemies.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A crackling sound like ice
	breaking split the air around the keep, and a breath of frozen mist
	sighed up from the whole circuit of the walls as water vapor in the
	surrounding air had all the heat abruptly sucked out of it.  The
	Keep of Torlane's outer face now appeared to be sheathed in a layer
	of blackened ice.   The continued barrages of the ice pellet clouds
	glittered impotently against the barrier, and slid off to the ground
	without doing any further damage to the walls.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Castellan Elungus signaled his
	palintone crews to give up on the catapults and concentrate instead
	on drilling the distant trebuchets to pieces.  The dark, ice-like
	substance sheathing Torlane's walls also had the side-effect of
	rendering them too cold and slick to scale, forcing the Corivite
	pioneers to abandon their ladders and grappling lines.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">By noon, all the enemy siege
	engines within range were broken, and the besieging force had
	withdrawn out of range.  Their casualties had been heavy, while
	those among the defenders had been light.  Justin released the charm
	binding the victorious but battered giants, and they wavered and
	faded from view, leaving behind a sulfurous vapor that soon
	dispersed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana rejoined them on the
	parapet, looking weary but satisfied.  Elungus and his officers
	saluted her with admiration, and Justin gave her a brief hug.  &ldquo;How
	long can you maintain the cold barrier effect?&rdquo; he asked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She shrugged.  &ldquo;Another hour
	or two, if I must.  It's very tiring.  I suggest you make what
	repairs you can before I drop it.  I'll open gaps so you can get
	near the damaged sections.&rdquo;  Probably few other Alliance
	magicians could have sustained such an effect for more than a few
	minutes, but Riksana's powers of concentration were legendary, and
	deservedly so.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Elungus nodded, and turned away to
	issue some orders concerning damage repair teams.  For a moment the
	Sing couple was alone and could step outside the rules of simulation
	etiquette.  &ldquo;This has played very smoothly today,&rdquo;
	Justin opined.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Better than usual, in
	fact,&rdquo; Riksana agreed.  &ldquo;I wonder how it went for the
	bio-Sings, and elsewhere besides here?  There were only a hundred or
	so PCs here at this battle today, I'd guess.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The lunar network extension
	is really shaping up.  Maybe we should become permanent residents,&rdquo;
	he said with a light laugh.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I don't think we have quite
	enough computing power up here yet to be comfortable working on all
	the real projects that&ndash;&rdquo;  She trailed off, and her eyes
	widened as her face paled.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin stepped closer to her. 
	&ldquo;Love?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I just realized.  Justin,
	it's energy!  Energy states.  One blocking another.  It's how we can
	dampen the quantum feedback.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin stared at her,
	thunderstruck.  &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; he breathed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It's a fresh approach, at
	least.  I'll need to work out the matrices, design some
	simulations.&rdquo;  She faced Justin and squared her shoulders,
	took a deep breath.  &ldquo;Tell Elungus to hurry up with those
	repairs.  I need to get back to work.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He grinned and gave her a proud,
	enthusiastic kiss.  Then he stalked off along the parapet, shouting
	for the Castellan.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The gardens were
	sumptuous: colorful, varied, immaculately groomed, with bright sun
	and cool shade, and countless paths to stroll upon.  Truly the
	famous gardens at Versailles had nothing on this place, although the
	design and the inspiration here were quite different.  Five people
	sat around a low table in a sort of gazebo, sipping cool drinks. 
	Salma and Clay, Cylara and Torch, dressed in casual summer garb, and
	a man by himself seated between the two couples.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I understand that I have
	you to thank for bumping me up the priority queue,&rdquo; said
	Arturo Scalleni.  He was a tanned, fit man, a bit short, with wiry
	dark hair, seemingly around thirty.  His appearance tallied closely
	with what his cousin Salma remembered of him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was no bother, I assure
	you,&rdquo; Clay replied, hoisting his flavored iced tea in salute. 
	The others also murmured soft denials.  Arturo leaned over to give
	his cousin a peck on the cheek.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">All the same, I'm grateful
	that you did what you did.  I might be missing out right now, even
	if I did eventually get brought in later on.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So what was it like, being
	Scanned?&rdquo; Cylara asked curiously.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Arturo set down his drink and
	shrugged.  &ldquo;The actual transition wasn't much at all, really. 
	Not that I can remember.  I was awakened out of a sound sleep, by a
	creepy feeling that something was very wrong.  I got out of bed and
	shrugged into a robe, and I heard this sort of vibrating noise, like
	an an old internal-combustion engine, faint but getting closer.  I
	thought maybe there was an aircraft flying low towards our village. 
	I started to walk toward the outer door to take a look outside, and
	all of a sudden I saw this light.  But it wasn't really light, it
	was more like just finding myself in this bright whiteness, with
	nothing else around.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A voice told me, 'This is
	the Cronus Scanner operator.  A flash flood is about to strike your
	dwelling, and you are about to die.  We have scanned your complete
	mindfile and can bring you forward in time and instantiate you as a
	non-biological Sing.  Is this agreeable to you?'&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm afraid I was a bit
	confused, and I stammered out something like: 'This is the Last
	Trumpet Project?'  The voice replied, 'Yes, so called.  If you need
	to think about it, you may take as long as you like.'</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well that confused me even
	more.  I asked, 'But I thought you said there was a flood coming?' 
	There was a gentle, kindly laugh in response.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">'The wall of water has
	already struck by now.  You are scanned but suspended in
	transition.'  I thought about this for only a moment, and then I
	recalled what I'd heard about how a buffer was used to obtain the
	consent of the scanned individual.  I realized that this must be
	where I was now.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So I said, 'Well since I
	can't go back, I'll go forward.  Yes &ndash; my answer is yes.'</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Next thing I knew I was in
	this posh apartment, standing there in my robe and all.  There was
	this huge closet full of clothes and the closet door was open, with
	a full-length mirror next to it.  My reflection didn't look any
	different.  I looked sleepy and startled.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Then my Paia was standing
	there next to me, and she said, 'Welcome, sir.  You should find
	everything you need in the closet.  I made certain everything is in
	your size and in the styles you prefer.  I'm instructed to tell you
	that Dr. Stefan Jager will be calling on you in approximately half
	an hour.  He will brief you on your newfound circumstances.'</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So what could I do?  I got
	ready.  It may amuse you to hear it, but out of habit I took a
	shower first before getting dressed.  It wasn't until I was shaving
	in front of the mirror that I realized that I didn't have a physical
	body anymore, and that if I wanted to be clean or dirty or shaved or
	bearded I could just will the alteration.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Paia told me the date when
	I asked.  It was February 20<SUP>th</SUP> &ndash; a week ago now &ndash;
	so I had been out of time for nearly two months.  She also told me
	that Dr. Jager wanted to hire me to work on his Project, and advised
	me that the terms were excellent and I should accept.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Stefan showed up in person
	shortly after that, and we had a really good interview.  He
	explained what was going on with the Project, and how it had a
	pressing need to expand its operations exponentially.  Paia was
	right about the terms he offered, so I accepted on the spot.  I had
	a couple of contracts going before, but it seems that, legally
	speaking, you get out of them when you're pronounced dead.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The other four had to laugh with
	him at that.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So what else did Stefan
	tell you?&rdquo; Torch asked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Oh, just general stuff
	about the Project.  He did mention, though, that they were going to
	Scan everyone who had lived in our village.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Why?&rdquo; Salma inquired.
	 &ldquo;I mean, that's great, but why everyone from that one
	disaster?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Art looked a little uncomfortable.
	 &ldquo;Apparently on account of how we weren't all just killed, we
	were all murdered.  It seems the dam was undermined with explosive
	devices.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The others exchanged stunned
	glances.  &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Clay got out.  &ldquo;Holy hell.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">How did they discover
	that?&rdquo; Torch asked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Arturo grinned.  &ldquo;Ran the
	Scanner backwards at the dam, of course.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch looked a little dumbfounded,
	then embarrassed.  &ldquo;Oh, right.  Should have thought of that.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But who would want to kill
	everyone in your community?&rdquo; Cylara wondered.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Dunno.  Stefan wanted to
	know that too.  They're still hunting for a motive.  It looks like
	some of the men involved may be religious terrorists.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay's face darkened.  &ldquo;That
	fits.  Damned KOJ scumbags.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch turned to him with a
	quizzical look.  &ldquo;Kay oh jay?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Knights of Jesus.  Bunch of
	extremist religious Moshes.  Luddites.  Want to turn back the clock
	to the middle ages.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well, I'm sure they'll find
	out who was behind it and why, eventually,&rdquo; Arturo said,
	obviously anxious for a change of subject.  &ldquo;It sure has been
	a whirlwind week for me since.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara took a slow, savoring drink
	of her tea.  &ldquo;So what's it like, being a Full Sing?&rdquo; she
	wanted to know.  Torch gave her a sharp glance, then turned his
	attention to Art as if very interested in the answer himself.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm not sure how to
	describe it,&rdquo; Art replied after a moment.  &ldquo;It <I>is</I>
	different, and it isn't.  I don't <I>feel</I> any different.  I
	mean, I'm still me, Art Scalleni.  I have the same memories, same
	likes and dislikes.  I do have better recall.  Anything I know, I
	can remember at will.  No more having something at the tip of your
	tongue.  It's either there or it's not.   I'm gradually getting used
	to the idea that I don't have to zone out and go back to my
	meatspace body, no matter how long I stay immersed.  Virtuality is
	home, now.  I just keep zoning around.  Not much different than what
	I used to do during long immersions, before.  You know how it is.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The four still-biological Sings
	nodded.  Scalleni shrugged and continued.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I suppose my thoughts are a
	little bit clearer, and I process information even faster.  I could
	relive every second of the past week in detail if I wanted to.  I
	don't get tired, but I do still appreciate relaxing episodes, like
	walking in these gardens.  I don't really sleep, but I do sort of go
	idle once in a while, and find that refreshing.  Started work two
	days ago; that's all in virtuality of course.   I've spent a lot of
	time with Jenny, naturally, but we never met in meatspace anyway, so
	that isn't really different.  I find I have this thirst for
	knowledge, for beauty, for emotionally moving experiences.  But I
	don't know whether that's being intensified by my new state, or
	merely by the fact that I'm very aware that I nearly lost my
	existence &ndash; you know, the way that a brush with mortality or
	illness always makes life seem more dear.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We all do a lot of our
	thinking on circuitry,&rdquo; Torch said musingly.  &ldquo;But does
	it bother you that you're now thinking <I>only</I> on circuitry?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Arturo looked at him. 
	&ldquo;Truthfully, no.  In the brain, thoughts are the result of
	chemical interactions.  In circuitry they're the result of
	electrical or molecular interactions.  Either way, we don't have any
	thoughts that aren't mirrored by some kind of physical process.   So
	what's the difference, mere efficiency?  That's only a difference of
	degree.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay offered, &ldquo;So you're
	happy as a Full Sing, is what I hear you saying.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes, I'd have to say I am. 
	The only thing that bothers me about the whole thing, is the seconds
	between when I got scanned and when my biological body died.  I
	can't remember them.  I asked Stefan about it.  He said I went to
	the door and opened it, saw the wall of water coming, and leaped
	back inside.  They scanned me before I did that, so that I wouldn't
	be all adrenalized and panicked when they put the question to me. 
	Which was very considerate, really.  But I know that some part of
	myself &ndash; the biological part &ndash; took those steps and
	opened that door and saw, and then felt what?  Panic, pain, sudden
	blackness?  I can't remember that.  I don't remember dying.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And you wonder whether that
	was you, that died, and whether you're just an impostor, a copy,&rdquo;
	supplied Torch.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Art Scalleni shook his head.  &ldquo;I
	wouldn't go that far.   I know who I am, and I'm no impostor.   It
	just troubles me somehow that for a few moments, there were two of
	me, and I only have the memories of one.  The other stopped.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In theory, any of us could
	be replicated even without dying in the flesh,&rdquo; Clay said. 
	&ldquo;The reason people don't do it is because of ethics, and
	because of the very discomfort that you're feeling.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Arturo nodded soberly.  &ldquo;Yes,
	there's nothing that prevents the Cronus Scanner from being used
	much earlier in a person's life than immediately before their
	biological death.  In fact, in cases of brain injuries, advanced
	senility, and the like, it would surely be much kinder to do it
	before those conditions arose.  And, too, there's nothing preventing
	me from using MM to create a perfect replica of my original human
	body and then re-inhabiting it.  I understand that some of us do
	that when they need to interact with Moshes whom they cannot meet
	and greet in virtuality.  I haven't tried anything like that myself
	yet, though.&rdquo;  It was quite stunning to think of the Last
	Trumpet Project's process as being effectively reversible, but the
	logic was undeniable.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Which brings us back to the
	Patternistic Theory of Existence,&rdquo; Clay concluded.  &ldquo;It's
	not the matter or energy through which you exist that makes you you.
	 It's the persistent organizing pattern of that matter or energy
	that is you.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What people call the soul,&rdquo;
	Salma agreed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes,&rdquo; Art said.  &ldquo;If
	the soul is anything, it is a pattern.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But isn't there a soul that
	goes on, that still exists, even after the pattern of matter and
	energy is gone?&rdquo; Torch asked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You mean, like a ghost?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No.  If ghosts existed they
	would be some form of organized matter or energy as well.  I mean a
	purely metaphysical soul, without physical existence.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That sounds like
	postulating the existence of something that, by definition, doesn't
	exist.  You got me there,&rdquo; Art admitted.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That's a <I>really</I>
	hypothetical question, Torchy,&rdquo; said Cylara, patting his arm.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Suppose there weren't any
	hypothetical questions?&rdquo; Salma said wonderingly, getting a
	general laugh which served to lighten the mood.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Did you keep your Paia?&rdquo;
	Cylara wanted to know.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Arturo smiled.  &ldquo;Oh yes, I
	couldn't be without her.  There's suddenly all kinds of people who
	want to talk to me.  She's running interference.  And Stefan
	provided me with this cool upgrade for her, so that she can zone in
	to join me wherever I am, whenever I need to talk to her about
	something.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cool,&rdquo; Cylara said,
	nodding.  &ldquo;I know I sure wouldn't want to be without mine.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yours is a chick, right?&rdquo;
	Salma asked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara laughed.  &ldquo;Yeah. 
	Well maybe I always wanted a sister.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma rolled her eyes.  &ldquo;Mine's
	a dude, and he's gorgeous.  I've always wanted some hot guy to wait
	on me hand and foot, and this one just won't do it,&rdquo; she said
	jostling Clay with her elbow.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Hey, I never promised you a
	rose garden,&rdquo; Clay said with mock indignation.  Arturo pointed
	at a nearby bed of roses and raised an eyebrow.  &ldquo;Okay, so
	we're <I>in</I> a rose garden at the moment, but I still never
	promised you one.&rdquo;  The women laughed.  Clay took another sip
	of tea, then looked back at Art.  &ldquo;I got a job offer from
	Stefan myself a while ago.  I accepted.  I'm going to be working on
	the marketing and public relations campaign.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Hey, that's great!  I don't
	expect I'll be working with you myself, but welcome aboard.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Thanks.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">All the serious discussion now out
	of the way, the five Sings sat around relaxing and talking and

	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The weather was
	warm for early March, even in Miami.   The night air was almost
	still, full of a mugginess that presaged the oncoming heat and
	humidity which were only a few months away.  Ubiquitous palms stood
	limp, their glossy dark fronds giving back only the faintest
	reflections of city lights.  The eastern horizon, where the Atlantic
	began, was black and utterly blank.  In this modern day city, the
	night traffic of vehicles, on the ground or in the air, was modest. 
	Light twinkled from many buildings, while some were dark.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A large truck with canvas sides
	hove to a stop in the middle of a street.  It was not at an
	intersection, nor next to any obvious destination, yet it halted as
	if it had arrived.   Men in dark clothing, about twenty of them,
	piled out the back end.  The men carried projectile weapons and
	other equipment, and moved swiftly, methodically.  Several of them
	worked quickly to open a nearby manhole cover.  Then the men began
	clambering down ladders inside, beneath the street.  Guys still on
	the surface fetched more paraphernalia out of the truck and handed
	it down to those on the ladders.  Briskly, efficiently, everything
	was ferried underground.  The manhole cover was reapplied, and the
	last couple of men jumped back into the truck, whereupon it drove
	away down the street.  The entire operation appeared to have gone
	unwitnessed by anything sapient.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Neither was there any immediately
	obvious result of the sudden odd dispersal of armed men into the
	city's antique sewer system.   It was a full half hour later when
	the exterior lights in an old office building some two and a half
	blocks from the manhole were suddenly extinguished.  Even that
	didn't seem as odd as the muffled detonations that leaked from the
	darkened building into the quiet streets outside, or the dancing
	flames that bloomed into life within its lower windows.  Soon the
	office complex was engulfed on its lower floors, and alarms were
	spreading through the tropical night.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The old truck now stood parked in
	a nearby alley, its headlights illuminating a second opened manhole,
	out of which the demolition team climbed.  When all the men were on
	the surface and accounted for, the cover was replaced.  Exchanging
	high fives and pumping their fists, the team boarded the truck,
	their enthusiasm dampened only slightly by the chiding of their
	officers to keep it down.  The truck's hydrogen-fueled motor sprang
	instantly to life and it lurched away, turning at the end of the
	alley to merge into what little traffic there was.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A seagull's eye view of the Miami
	metro area would have shown a handful of other fires breaking out in
	unexpected places.  The emergency crews were suddenly deployed in
	one direction, only to receive conflicting calls in a different
	direction.  After the first few dispatches, there was simply no one
	left to send.  As a result, several fires spread beyond their
	designated targets.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Alarms began to spread in the
	cyberverse as well, triggered by live feed imagery of the brightly
	lit events in meatspace, coupled with the internal stimulus of mesh
	nodes going dark.  It did not take long for the relationship to
	become obvious.  From the cyberverse it was possible to see what
	even a high-flying seagull could not: that the same pattern of
	events was unfolding in practically every major city across the
	North American Federation, and in pockets around the globe.  In a
	hundredth-monkey kind of way, knowledge of the unfolding disaster
	began to permeate even to those people and intelligent systems who
	were as yet unaffected by it, nor even paying attention.  A
	collective gasp, like a frisson of danger, rippled out through
	virtuality.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Amplified intelligence deduced
	both the cause and the source of the damage with lightning speed and
	laser-like accuracy.   Like an atavistic response to injury, a
	statistically significant percentage of the neural and electrical
	circuitry forming the cyberverse began to modulate anger.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Homeland Security
	Secretary Roger Sarner gazed contentedly at the holoscreen in front
	of him.  It showed a revolving timetable of raids in progress, raids
	completed, and raids scheduled to begin.  Hundreds of them, all over
	the North American continent, in major cities, obscure towns, even
	unlikely spots out in the boondocks.  The logistical planning and
	coordination that had gone into this was prodigious.  Especially
	given that the final mobilization and implementation had had to be
	done with little more than three days' lead time.  Sarner was proud
	to bursting of his people: his planners, his coordinators, his team
	leaders, his aides, the supply and communications folks, hell even
	the KOJ commandos who supplemented his raid forces.  It was all
	working so perfectly it gave him a lump in his throat.  This was
	what <I>humans</I> could do, by God!  Good old-fashioned biological
	ingenuity and get-her-done creativity and discipline.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He glanced at the chronometer.  It
	showed 03/03/45 03:27 PST.  The third hour of the third day of the
	third month of 2045.  The repeated threes and the 3-4-5 seemed
	pregnant with significance.  This was surely a history-shaping hour,
	one which would be long remembered.  Operation Skull Fracture was
	bound to cast a long, grand shadow into the future.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Four days ago, when word had come
	from Cleary's inside informant that the Sings knew all about the dam
	sabotaged last December, it had felt like the all time low point of
	his career.  It was obvious that it wouldn't take them long to
	figure out just how at risk so many of their big brain houses were. 
	But in that tough moment, the tough had gotten going, as a famous
	general had once said, a hundred years ago in another great struggle
	to preserve their way of life against evil.  A go/no-go decision
	needed to be made, on the spot.  And he, Roger Sarner, had made it.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The alarming news that Cleary's
	people had reported demanded immediate action, an acceleration of
	the timetable.  He'd flown directly to meet with Reverend Cleary in
	person, expecting to encounter a whole lot of opposition from his
	KOJ counterpart.  Somewhat to his surprise, Cleary had backed his
	decision almost immediately, coming over to Sarner's position so
	quickly that he figured what protest Cleary did make was a shuck,
	just for form's sake.  He had expected Cleary's monumental ego to
	make it impossible for him to want to start the operation early, on
	account of a stupid screwup his own people had made.  Instead,
	Cleary had openly admitted that in hindsight the operation at the
	dam had been a mistake.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It sure was.  Nobody had thought
	about the possibility that the Sings could use that damned Scanner
	to spy on them.  But once they had a reason to use it that way,
	there was no reason to think they would stop.  Sarner fervently
	hoped that the hardware running that damnable device was somewhere
	in one of the targets on his list tonight, and that it got melted to
	slag.  If it didn't, there would be trouble down the line.  He
	figured there was at least some possibility that it would get hit.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">One good thing that had recently
	come back from tracing their KOJ informant was the location of a
	previously unknown brain house, which they knew for a fact had
	hosted a meeting with a dead guy who'd been scanned by the Project. 
	That brain house was in some godforsaken spot in Labrador, and it
	was a late addition to tonight's hit list.  But from now on they had
	to keep the blitz going, keep the Sings perpetually off-balance so
	they couldn't retaliate.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He touched a control and brought
	up a casualty report.  Looked good.  So far, only a few fools who
	got careless and fell down ladders or something, no serious injuries
	or fatalities reported.  There was no way to estimate possible
	collateral casualties, people in the brain houses, that sort of
	thing.  Standard orders were to subdue and arrest anyone found at a
	target scene, but there was to be no account taken of any civvies
	who might happen to be inside a ground zero location when it went
	boom.  Goddamned Sings would start playing human shield games if
	they did that.  Those whom they couldn't arrest quickly on the scene
	were headed straight for a permanent spot on the missing persons
	list.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Operation had to be about
	halfway through, he reckoned.  East coast teams would be moving to
	their second or third string targets by now.  No team would do more
	than four, and most not more than three.   So far, there was
	negligible resistance.  One or two sysadmin types working on servers
	had chosen to draw weapons, but had been subdued or killed without
	anyone getting hurt.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">One of his aides handed him a
	fresh communique.  Glancing at it, for a moment his eyes got big,
	until he looked at the timestamp.  It was from Senator Robert
	Reynolds in Spokane.  The senator was dutifully reporting to the
	Homeland Security Secretary that there were &ldquo;suspicious fires
	and explosions&rdquo; going off all over his district, and possibly
	continent-wide.  Reynolds expressed his deep concern that this
	widespread pattern of destruction of property could be &ldquo;the
	work of a terrorist network as yet unknown, aimed at our vital
	infrastructure,&rdquo; and appealed to Sarner to undertake immediate
	investigative action and deploy appropriate countermeasures as
	needed to safeguard people and property.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yeah,&rdquo; he said aloud
	to the datapad containing Reynolds' message.  &ldquo;Bit slow on the
	uptake there, aren't you, Senator?&rdquo;  Damn fool always was.  No
	backbone, and only half a brain.  Guy was a clueless ditz who only
	knew how to shake hands and kiss babies.  Message was sent about two
	hours ago.  So, that would have been roughly one hour before
	Reynolds had gotten arrested.  Or rather, taken into protective
	custody.  It was the same for all fifteen Federation senators,
	except for one who was out of the country on vacation.  The
	President and her staff and family were locked down in a posh bunker
	somewhere in New Mexico, where they'd been diverted for their safety
	as soon as the Operation had begun.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You could always count on the
	media to do their bit.  Oh sure, they whined and sniveled and
	editorialized about civil liberties and shit like that, but blow
	something up in their backyard and they were all over it,
	guaranteed.  Sure to speculate too, about religious extremists,
	Luddite terrorists, you name it.  Sarner's office didn't even have
	to plan a plausible explanation for what was going on with Operation
	Skull Fracture.  All they had to do was let the media concoct a few
	of their own, and run out and conduct a few quick polls to find out
	which one the public believed the most.  Once the media handed the
	perfect, pre-vetted scenario over to them on a silver platter, then
	the Homeland Security office would announce that yes, that was
	indeed the cause.  The media folks felt like geniuses when they got
	it right, and the majority of the public was reassured that they
	knew what was going on, too.   So it all worked out for everyone.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner wasn't sure what they'd
	come up with this time.  Terrorists?  Foreign espionage agents? 
	Hell, frigging space aliens?  But it didn't matter.  He was sure of
	one thing: whatever explanation seemed most acceptable to the masses
	could sure as hell get spun into a crisis big enough to keep him
	calling the shots for a long time to come.  Stupid ass politicians
	were always dumb enough to write up emergency powers clauses in laws
	and constitutions.  As of now, and no doubt for the foreseeable
	future, the Secretary of Homeland Security was effectively in charge
	of the North American Federation.  The President and other elected
	officials were far too important to be risked in the current climate
	of terror and uncertainty.  So they'd stay right where they were,
	probably indefinitely, which was just fine with Sarner.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Still, he had to thank Reynolds
	for being so considerate as to send this note asking him to do
	whatever it took to keep the Federation safe.  That kind of appeal
	implied real confidence in Sarner's ability to do his job.  Couple
	of these bits here, those were downright quotable.  Sarner circled
	the sentences he thought might be useful, and handed the pad back to
	his aide, who was still hovering nearby.  &ldquo;Public relations
	department,&rdquo; he directed laconically.  They'd know what to do
	without any further instructions.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A well-oiled machine, that's what
	he'd created.  That's what government was when it really got going. 
	A good crisis cranked everybody up, got the adrenaline flowing,
	brought out the best in dedicated men and women.  There really
	hadn't been any big crises in meatspace in recent years, but there
	was now.  Heh heh, be a helluva big crisis in cyberspace too come to
	think of it.  He couldn't help grinning.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner got up to stretch and pace
	around his command center.  He paused to offer some kindly
	encouragement and verbal back patting to the staff as he moved from
	station to station.  Command should always look confident, somebody
	once said.  And pleased, when things were going as well as all this
	was going.  By dawn more than half a thousand major brain houses
	would be slag and ashes.  Which was a pretty fair night's work, no
	doubt about it.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He paused at the live Ferret
	display, a screen so big it took up almost an entire wall.  This was
	a real-time picture of all the packets being sent around the
	worldwide mesh, or at least around North America, which was of
	course the focus of the display.  A handful of other governments
	abroad had agreed to joint operations, but those were very limited
	in scope, little more than symbolic.  He and Cleary hoped that the
	Federation's success tonight would spur the less committed regimes
	to action in the future.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">If that ever happened, the live
	worldwide map of the mesh would look like North America did right
	now.   The holo images were scaled by brightness and color, with
	light colors like white and yellow indicating &ldquo;hot&rdquo;
	zones where lots of packets were flying around, shading to darker
	greens, blues, and reds in the cooler areas &ndash; something like a
	severe weather map in reverse.  Just at a glance you could see that
	there were fewer bright spots than there were two hours ago.  Though
	the map as a whole didn't seem to have dimmed all that much.  There
	were also some localized spots that were now burning brighter than
	they had been, typically next to areas which were now darker.  That
	was a bit worrisome.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What's that, tech?&rdquo;
	he inquired, pointing at an incandescent bit near Dallas.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Nothing to worry about,
	sir.  It's the way DR.OS works.  As resources go offline, demand
	shifts automatically to nearby spare capacity.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner nodded pleasantly.  &ldquo;So
	what you're saying is that that there is one we missed.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes, sir.  It was probably
	just a backup system, not in regular use so it didn't show up as a
	mainline target.  Older equipment, maybe.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well, good target for round
	two, then.  Convenient, how killing one brain house leads us right
	to the backup system.  Sounds like just what the <I>doctor</I>
	ordered.&rdquo;  The tech's mouth twitched in a grin, so he
	obviously got the pun, but he didn't go so far as to laugh.  &ldquo;Carry
	on, son,&rdquo; Sarner said and turned away.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The tech's harsh gasp made him
	turn right back.  The Ferret screen was suddenly dark, all of it. 
	The tech fluttered keys and control surfaces like his fingers were
	doing flamenco air guitar on his console.  Nothing happened.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner cleared his throat.  &ldquo;Am
	I to understand that our teams have suddenly eliminated the entire
	global mesh?&rdquo; he asked sarcastically.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Um, I'm afraid not, sir,&rdquo;
	the tech muttered, too flustered to notice his commander was ribbing
	him.  His fingers kept dancing around, between anxious, reflective
	pauses.  A crowd was beginning to gather on this side of the room,
	staring at the blank screen.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So, what would you say is
	happening, then?&rdquo; Sarner asked after a moment.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The tech shot him a nervous
	glance.  &ldquo;I'm not sure, sir.  I can tell you that our links to
	Ferret are up and working.  We're just not getting any data from the
	feed.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner pondered, feeling the
	beginnings of anger stirring within him.  Could this be the
	resistance he'd been expecting, which had been absent so far?  A
	counterattack against Ferret would be a telling blow for the Sings
	to strike.  &ldquo;If it's not a malfunction, is it enemy action?&rdquo;
	he queried softly, but with a hard edge in his voice.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm sorry sir, I can't tell
	from here,&rdquo; the Ferret tech replied.  &ldquo;Everything's
	working, it's just&ndash;&rdquo;  He shrugged apologetically.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner turned irritably to one of
	his undersecretaries, who was in charge of technical operations.  He
	jabbed his finger at him.  &ldquo;Get a team in action, now.  I
	don't care if you have to roust them all out of bed, do it.  Find
	out why we're getting no data from Ferret.  Don't take any bullshit
	excuses.  This is no time for an equipment breakdown, and if we're
	under attack I want to know right away.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Right, sir.&rdquo;  The man
	snapped a salute and hurried away.  Sarner turned up his palms in a
	half shrug that silently asked the gathered crowd what they were
	doing away from their stations.  Without a word they all turned and
	went back to their work.  He smiled reassuringly, and returned to
	his own seat.  Whatever was up with Ferret, it certainly wasn't
	impeding the Operation, which continued to progress nicely.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Half an hour later, with the
	Ferret monitor screen still annoyingly dark, his undersecretary
	returned, walking stiffly, wearing an expression like the mouse
	picked to bell the cat.  Sarner surmised it was not good news.  He
	faced his underling as he strode up, twisted an eyebrow at him, but
	said nothing.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Um, sir.  The Ferret main
	system hardware appears to have been destroyed, sir.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner's jawline bulged as he
	clenched his teeth, but he betrayed no other reaction, yet.  Damn
	Sings!  <I>If we could locate their key systems it only made sense
	that they could locate ours</I>, he thought.  But it was damned
	inconvenient, that was for sure.  Without Ferret to analyze mesh
	traffic patterns...</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It, uh, does not appear to
	have been enemy action, sir.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Secretary was gobsmacked.  
	&ldquo;Then what in the hell was it?&rdquo;  Around him he could
	feel the rest of the command center staff's ears tuned in like those
	old dish antennas.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Now the technical undersecretary
	looked really unhappy.  &ldquo;As near as we can tell,&rdquo; he got
	out in a matter-of-fact voice, &ldquo;it appears to have been, uh,
	friendly fire.  Sir.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The proverbial pin could have
	crashed to the floor and made everyone jump out of their skins. 
	Sarner's mind went black with rage.  Such unbelievable stupidity! 
	Yet he exercised the full iron control that he always commanded in
	the most dire circumstances, and couldn't help being pleased at the
	fear he felt pulsing around the room, generating the extreme quiet. 
	No one seemed even to breathe, waiting on his reaction.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Johnson, are you telling me
	that we blew up our own computer facility tonight?&rdquo; he said at
	last, simply and calmly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Uh, it does look that way,
	sir.  One of the strikes in Southern California, out near China
	Lake.  It appears that a number of government systems were hosted in
	that location, unfortunately including Ferret.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A number of systems?  What
	else?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Just some records storage. 
	Most of it old data from the former United States, sir.  We're still
	compiling the list of what's missing.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner stared levelly at his
	undersecretary for a moment, then spoke more softly.  &ldquo;And do
	you have any theories as to why no one thought to cross-reference
	our operational target list with known government data centers?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Undersecretary Johnson looked even
	more unhappy, if that was possible.  &ldquo;Um, not yet sir.  It
	appears to have been an... oversight.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner leaned forward slightly in
	his chair, staring at Johnson with narrowed eyes, as if he were some
	truly amazing curiosity.  &ldquo;An <I>oversight</I>.  Yes, I guess
	you could certainly say that.   Well, I want to know whose.  On my
	desk.  Nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  Go.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Poor Johnson didn't salute, he
	positively bowed, a quick nod of the head and a tilt of his upper
	body.  Then he fled the room, glad to be dismissed.  Sarner knew
	there was no question at all that by tomorrow morning he'd have
	found the culprit.  Or somebody who could be made to look
	responsible, at any rate.  Ultimately, it didn't matter.  Someone
	had to pay.  This kind of fuckup was downright treasonable.  <I>Deprive
	us of a weapon like Ferret at this juncture</I>, he fumed.  An
	example needed to be made, with plenty of emphasis on the treason
	aspect, yes, that would be good.  To keep this kind of shit from
	happening again.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Still, there might be a silver
	lining of sorts.  With the government of the North American
	Federation having taken such a hit to its intelligence capability,
	it would certainly give the lie to any perceptive radicals who might
	claim that government personnel were involved in carrying out the
	bombings.  On the other hand, it might not be good to admit that
	Ferret was no longer operational.  Hard to tell which way to go was
	best.  He'd need to ask his advisors in the propaganda and domestic
	surveillance departments.  But for now, he was going to surprise
	everyone here by not blowing up in a rage.  To stay in control of
	others, sometimes you needed to show that you could control
	yourself, too.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But damn it, why did something
	like this always have to happen to ruin a perfect night, when
	everything else was going so incredibly well?  That was what he
	really couldn't figure out.  But as long as he'd been in public

	Of course it was a given that the hapless Johnson wouldn't be
	getting any sleep, either.  He grinned, grimly, staring into his

	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay couldn't
	help but think that this performance was a bit lacking somehow. 
	Othello was a great play, to be sure, but this supposedly authentic
	Renaissance recreation of its premiere engagement didn't quite
	measure up to his standards, based on previous performances which
	he'd attended.   The staging wasn't that good, the costumes looked
	worn out, and the actors delivered their lines accurately, but
	without conveying any sense that they realized they were
	participating in the debut of a dramatic masterpiece.  It was like
	it was just another night's work for them.  Mayhap the problem was
	that the recreation was <I>too</I> authentic.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He enjoyed Shakespeare as well as
	the next man, but attending tonight's performance had really been
	Salma's idea.  She loved dressing up like an Elizabethan lady and
	acting out the part of a member of the audience with, he had to
	admit, at least as much authenticity and enthusiasm as was being
	shown by the actors on stage.   Salma's ample bust rose and fell in
	her bodice with her breathing, and Clay kept finding himself
	distracted by it.   Coupled with the warmth of her hand that he was
	discreetly holding, it reminded him of the exquisite soft crush of
	those perfect beauties when they made love.  Which in turn was
	something he could scarcely contemplate without squirming in his
	seat like a fidgety kid.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">More than a decade ago, when the
	direct augmentation of human intelligence began to be practical,
	some wags had put forth the notion, quite surprising in retrospect,
	that making people smarter would make them inherently less sexual.  
	Generally speaking, so far it hadn't worked out that way.  Instead,
	patterns of sexual behavior, fantasies, desires, and the means of
	gratifying them merely became more complex and subtle.  Advanced
	non-biological intelligence extrapolated from the human became, in
	some ways, more human than the original.   Which Clay supposed was
	understandable.  What, after all, was the use of more brainpower if
	you didn't use it to have more fun in life?   Not to mention the
	fact that in virtuality, everyone had an avatar body that was,
	naturally, perfect &ndash; at least according to their own
	definition of perfection.  Like Salma's.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Having come full circle in his
	thoughts, he shifted in his seat again.  Still only the second act. 
	Salma took a deeper breath, and gave his hand a knowing squeeze,
	though her attention remained fixed on the stage.   He could only
	sigh faintly, play along, and try to concentrate on the dialog.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Abruptly one of the actors seemed
	to be in doubt as to his next line.  He was just standing there,
	with everyone (both on stage and in the house) looking at him
	expectantly.   Was this some kind of extreme verisimilitude, an
	incident from the premiere being perpetrated as an exercise in
	radical authenticity?  If so, Clay couldn't help thinking it was
	going too far.  Salma flicked a sidelong glance at him, suggesting
	that she thought so, too.  Then the actor's form wavered and
	disappeared, right off the middle of the stage.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A murmur of surprise went through
	the audience, generated partly by the NPC constituent, who were
	expressing appropriate Elizabethan amazement at such a disturbingly
	fine and unexpected bit of stage magic, and partly by the non-AI
	attendees like Clay and Salma, who were expressing shock and
	disbelief at the incredible gaffe.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Just as suddenly, only a few
	seconds later, the character reappeared and resumed speaking as if
	nothing had happened.  The whole theater gasped again.  Subtle
	differences in the acting style and speaking diction suggested to
	the modern audience members an explanation of what had probably
	happened: the actor had lost his connection to the theater's server,
	and been replaced by an NPC actor controlled by the theater's AI. 
	Which implied a fairly serious technical malfunction, these days.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A few minutes later, as the stage
	was being set for the next scene, several audience members likewise
	winked out.  What the hell?  In the event of a temporary disconnect
	due to network difficulties, any virtuality's AI would be programmed
	to smooth over the fault by continuing the gesture already in
	progress, finishing a sentence, implementing a stammer, or otherwise
	papering over the fact that a client was link-dead for a few
	seconds.  A handful of seconds was all it typically took to
	renegotiate a fresh connection that worked around whatever had
	caused the communications disruption.  For an AI just to let avatars
	vanish into thin air, the disruption had to be serious, and
	permanent.  Clay had only seen the like a few times before, in all
	the years since he'd begun practically living in virtuality.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What in the world is wrong
	with this place?&rdquo; Salma whispered, leaning towards him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Um, I know not milady, but
	methinks the historic recreation atmosphere be spoilt now.&rdquo; 
	But mayhap there would be a silver lining to that, he thought.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She gave a soft, reproving snort. 
	&ldquo;M'lord doth not jest.  Maybe we'd better hope the whole
	theater doesn't crash,&rdquo; she muttered and turned back to the
	stage, which looked almost ready for the next scene to begin.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay barely had time to roll his
	eyes in silent agreement when everything around him dissolved into
	grey mist, like 3D static.  Salma was gone, too.  Holy hell!  What
	was this, a power failure?  He flicked a thought at his immersion
	client console, which responded at once, and began performing the
	diagnostic he requested.  Nothing.  So that was all right then.  It
	wasn't a problem on his end.  Must have been the theater.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He sent a PM to Salma asking where
	she wanted to meet up.  Private messaging in virtuality worked a bit
	like telepathy, provided you had the other person's coordinates and
	they accepted your contact.  In only a couple of seconds, Salma's
	voice spoke in his head in response: &ldquo;Tout le Monde Cafe.&rdquo;
	 Her tone sounded both exasperated and amused.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Seconds later he zoned into the
	cafe's world, stepping out of a doorway into a street less than a
	block from the establishment.  It was early evening, on a summer day
	in a Parisian street sometime very early in the twentieth century. 
	Clay headed directly for the cafe's doors.  He walked in, doffing
	his hat, and sat down at one of their usual tables.  A waiter came
	over at once.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Good evening, Monsieur
	Thorsten.  Would you like your usual cafe au lait?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I would, Robere, thank
	you,&rdquo; he replied in perfect, unaccented French.  &ldquo;Mademoiselle
	Rivera will be joining me shortly.&rdquo;  Right on cue, a carriage
	clattered to a stop out front.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I perceive your timing is
	impeccable as always, Monsieur.  In that case, shall I fetch creme
	brulee as well?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Please.  Also a serving of
	those wonderful peach crepes, if you would.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Of course, Monsieur,&rdquo;
	Robere said as he turned away toward the kitchen.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma strode in and joined him,
	turning heads and getting smiles from the staff as she always did. 
	He rose and grasped one of her white-gloved hands as he conducted
	her into a seat opposite his with a slight bow.  She smoothed her
	voluminous dress and folded her hands on the lace-covered tablecloth
	in front of her.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Rather surprising ending to
	the play tonight,&rdquo; she offered, speaking French in deference
	to the setting.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Looks like the Globe burned
	down again.  I can't say I thought much of the second act, that's
	for sure.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I don't think you thought
	much of the whole thing, Monsieur.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">True, Mademoiselle.  I
	confess I was thinking too much of you.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She laughed coquettishly.  &ldquo;That's
	not exactly a news flash.  Let's see what is.&rdquo;  She pressed an
	embroidered design on the tablecloth and the bouquet of violets in
	the center of the table was replaced by a holoscreen display.   This
	cafe was only a superficial period recreation; it was also a coffee
	shop where patrons came to read the news of the contemporary world. 
	Salma quickly navigated to a breaking news feed, and entered the
	name of the theater company as search criteria.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Nothing came up.   What did come
	up though, was entry after entry from meatspace about explosions,
	sudden fires, and reports of parties of armed men breaking into
	buildings or emerging from sewers, all of which occurrences were
	being linked to widespread cyberverse outages.  Clay, who could see
	the exact same display from his side of the table, gaped.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It wasn't some random
	accidental equipment failure.  They must be deliberately destroying
	server hardware!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma met his gaze soberly.  &ldquo;It's
	the only thing that makes sense,&rdquo; she agreed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But it makes no sense at
	all,&rdquo; he protested.  &ldquo;Why blow up random systems?  A
	Shakespeare play, for God's sake?  Who'd want to disrupt that?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They say it is the Knights
	of Jesus, Monsieur,&rdquo; said Robere as he arrived to serve them
	their crepes, dessert, and coffee.  &ldquo;They are, so to speak, on
	a holy crusade.  They do not pick their targets with any care.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Because they hate all of it
	equally,&rdquo; Clay finished.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Just so, Monsieur.  Would
	Mademoiselle like sugar?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Please, Robere,&rdquo; she
	answered.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well, do you suppose we're
	safe here?&rdquo; Clay wondered aloud.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Robere wiped his hands on his
	apron and stood up proudly.  &ldquo;Indeed, Monsieur.  Here at the
	Tout le Monde we are hosted on only the most advanced of hardware,
	the better to facilitate our news feeds and the superbness of our
	flavors.  Our servers are located in a nanosteel capsule anchored on
	the bottom of the Bay of Biscay, in truth not many miles from the
	beloved soil of La France.  We expect no primitive terrorists <I>here</I>,&rdquo;
	he sniffed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well that's good to know,&rdquo;
	Clay allowed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Very reassuring, thank you
	Robere,&rdquo; Salma agreed with a smile.  He bowed, picked up his
	tray, slung his white towel over his shoulder, and headed back to
	the kitchen.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay watched some of the
	audio-visual vignettes of burning buildings and scurrying dark-clad
	ninja-like troops bristling with weapons, and his face darkened.  
	&ldquo;This can't be allowed to stand,&rdquo; he said darkly.  &ldquo;Who
	the hell do these dudes think they are?  What right have they got to
	go around blowing up other people's worlds?  The damn government has
	got to do something about this.  If they're worth anything at all.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma gave him a commiserating but
	calming look.  &ldquo;My dear, what makes you think the government
	isn't involved in doing this?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay looked surprised.  &ldquo;Wanton
	public disorder?  Random destruction of property, and probably even
	people?  Bit of a change of tune for the law and order pimps, isn't
	it?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not really.  Isn't that an
	apt description of what war is all about?  Governments have fought
	wars since time immemorial.  Besides, who else do you know of who
	has so many armed men at their disposal in meatspace?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay's eyebrows furrowed in
	thought, showing she had asked a good question.  &ldquo;Those KOJ
	fanatics might.  And there is no actual army anymore.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Maybe.  And maybe they're
	getting help from the Federation, which <I>does </I>still have
	security forces.  They'd at least have to be looking the other way,
	for something this widespread to happen.  And there's that Homeland
	Security czar, who's always talking like he wants to yank everybody
	out of the cyberverse and back into some militaristic socialist
	meatspace paradise, like the one people lived in before the
	cyberverse got started.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The government's full of
	reactionaries with retrograde delusions.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Exactly.  And maybe some of
	them are actually delusional enough to try turning back the clock. 
	That's all I'm saying.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay sighed, took a bite of
	delicious crepe.  &ldquo;At any rate, I suppose this <I>is</I> too
	big for the Federation dorks to handle, even if they aren't involved
	on the other side.  Folks are going to have to do for themselves.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma looked concerned.  &ldquo;Do
	what?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay gestured at the translucent
	holo image between them, with its dancing flames.  &ldquo;Protect
	their property.  Their way of life.  Do you want a bunch of nuts
	torching every theater we go to?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Of course not.  But quite a
	lot of the cyberverse systems have got to be out of their reach,
	like this cafe.  There's a lot of computing power in the sea, in
	orbit, on the moon, and out at L5 these days.  What they're hitting
	is probably mostly older gear in server farms leftover from the days
	of the internet, when the backbones weren't wireless and hosting
	hardware was therefore centralized.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I agree.  But that doesn't
	necessarily mean that they couldn't go on to target newer systems
	once they got done picking the low-hanging fruit.   Getting to orbit
	is trivial these days, Salma.  And even if they can't or won't, it
	sure as hell doesn't make what they're doing right.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Of course not.  But how
	would anyone stop them?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay shrugged, sipped coffee. 
	&ldquo;The same way you'd stop anybody like that.  You stop their
	fucking clocks.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma looked at him steadily. 
	&ldquo;You use violence, in other words.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Defensive violence. 
	There's a difference, sweetheart.   If they do nothing else, nothing
	happens to them.  But if they keep doing what they're doing, they
	get themselves iced.  Up to them.  Cause and effect.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay, you saw how many
	people were involved.  How would you stop them?  You're not a
	superhero.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Don't need to be, baby, I'm
	a marketing guy.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She laughed.  &ldquo;Yeah, right. 
	I was forgetting.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He looked mock-offended.  &ldquo;You
	think I'm not serious?  How many people do you think are really
	pissed off right now?  Just us?  I guarantee you there's one whole
	helluva lot of people just steaming over their holoscreens right
	now.  The call goes out for a massive posse, you think I couldn't
	sell that?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma thought about it seriously
	for a moment.  &ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;I'm

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reverend Maxwell
	Cleary tried to look more attentive than he felt.  Some of the
	Order's top logistical men were giving a detailed report assessing
	the results from Skull Fracture Day, now five days in the past. 
	Cleary had a pad and a pen open on the table before him.  He liked
	to take notes the old-fashioned way, by writing them in longhand. 
	But so far, below today's date he had only jotted down two figures:
	571 and 11%.  The first was the number of brain house targets which
	had been hit within the North American Federation.  The second was
	an estimate of the total degree of reduction in cyberverse packet
	traffic which had been observed.  The first number was according to
	plan; no attacks had failed.  The second number was a big
	disappointment.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Months of work and planning, a
	massive, interlocking, continent-wide operation involving thousands
	of commandos, and yet it had netted them just over a ten percent
	sized dent in virtuality.   There was of course some question as to
	the reliability of the traffic reduction estimate, in view of the
	tragic loss of the government's mesh monitoring engine, Ferret.  Now
	there was an oversight Sarner's people had committed which beggared
	his own mistake with the dam.  The argument concerning the degree of
	uncertainty in the figures had raged until Cleary had put a stop to
	the bickering amongst Christian brothers.  Whatever the precise
	figure ought to be, it was certainly much lower than they had all
	hoped.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">One of the brother Knights, who
	was a former brain house administrator, was now holding forth at
	some length concerning his explanation of why this was so.   Cleary
	found his attention wandering, the more technical the man's
	presentation became.  He also found the note of passionate interest,
	and pride in knowledge, in the speaking brother's voice rather
	disturbing.  Bad enough that a committed brother should have to fill
	his head with so much of the Adversary's knowledge, let alone take
	pride in the knowing of it, as if it were some distinction that set
	him above his brethren.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Nevertheless, he gathered that
	most of the computers which hosted the cyberverse ran something
	called DR.OS, for Distributed Resources Operating System.   This
	system permitted computers to offer processing, data storage, and
	data transmission and relay for sale at competitive metered rates. 
	It now appeared that the high concentration of computing hardware
	into centralized brain houses was due mainly to factors of
	minimizing transmission delays between systems, and economies of
	scale.  In other words, the big brain houses they'd destroyed had
	burned the brightest on the Ferret map because they were the
	cheapest paths for data.  Not the best or the most sophisticated,
	merely the least expensive and therefore the most utilized.  In
	fact, on the contrary, most of those sites now appeared to have
	contained mainly older systems, if anything <I>less</I>
	sophisticated on the average &ndash; which explained why their rates
	had been set lower.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Evidently an awful lot of spare
	capacity had existed, which the destruction of the older, lower cost
	systems had brought into immediate use.  The bottom line was that
	Operation Skull Fracture had done relatively little to deprive the
	denizens of the cyberverse of access to their counterfeit worlds. 
	It had merely raised the price of that access.  This, it was feared,
	would prove to be a temporary effect, obtaining only until the
	incentive of higher access fees resulted in the deployment of more
	competing resources.  Whereupon prices would fall again, with the
	end result that newer and better hardware would be available for the
	same or even less cost than before.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Perhaps even worse, the newer
	equipment had longer wireless transmission ranges, which allowed for
	more routing redundancy and necessitated much less centralization. 
	To say nothing of the fact that housing related servers in
	geographically disparate locations would, as of now, become standard
	practice.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Which meant that all they had
	really managed to accomplish was to cause the worldwide mesh to
	improve itself, and render itself less vulnerable to attack in
	future.  Reverend Cleary was reminded of the analogy of a forest
	fire ultimately renewing and improving the health and diversity of
	the forest.  It was ironic in the extreme.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But in the meantime, elevated
	costs <I>were</I> causing a slight reduction in traffic across the
	mesh.  There was also no question that certain unique data stores
	had been destroyed in the Operation.  However, even that now proved
	to be less widespread than they'd hoped.  It seemed that this DR.OS
	system facilitated redundant storage of important data files by
	&ldquo;striping&rdquo; them across multiple systems: specifically,
	computers that were sufficiently distant in terms of light-seconds
	to guarantee a significant geographical distribution of the
	component stripes.  Thus the only data the Operation had managed to
	destroy utterly was contained in files where one hundred percent of
	the striped fragments had all been stored in targeted brain houses. 
	Even in these cases the destruction might not have been total, if
	some fragments had gotten copied to other hosts once earlier copies
	became permanently inaccessible, triggering an automatic backup.  It
	had not been possible to wipe out all 571 brain houses
	simultaneously, and that meant that quite a lot of data may have
	gotten copied out, like rats fleeing a sinking ship, just as soon as
	the destruction of one copy caused the backup copy to clone itself
	elsewhere automatically.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was like fencing with a pool of
	water, Cleary reflected.  How in the world had the Devil's network
	gotten so clever, and so resilient?  Everyone in the Order had felt
	Called to take up arms in the struggle.  And had believed that all
	that was necessary to achieve the Lord's purpose was to answer that
	Call.  Yet now, today, forcibly contemplating this many-headed,
	adaptive hydra that was the global mesh, the efforts of Good seemed
	paltry.  Who would have guessed that their main achievement would be
	a small, transient reduction in mesh usage brought on by the price
	elasticity of demand in cyberspace?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">To say nothing of the fact that
	the enemy was now forewarned of their intentions and their
	willingness to act.   As Cleary half-listened to this brother up
	front nattering on pedantically about the reduced concentration
	density of self-extending geodesic networks, he couldn't help
	wondering what kind of reprisals might be getting planned in
	conference rooms in the cyberverse even now.  Would the Devil's
	creatures strike back?  And what should the Order undertake next?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary had already heard yesterday
	from Roger Sarner on that subject.   The Homeland Security Secretary
	was convinced that only relentless house-to-house search-and-destroy
	tactics would ensure victory.  Sarner was greatly encouraged by the
	fact that at all the sites they'd destroyed, there had been no
	resistance other than from a few maintenance and support personnel,
	taken by surprise and easily overwhelmed.  Accidents and friendly
	fire had accounted for all of their casualties, and remarkably, no
	one had been killed in any of the raid teams.  &ldquo;Our answer to
	decentralization must be determined thoroughness,&rdquo; Sarner said
	in his communique.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But Reverend Cleary wasn't so
	sure.  The 571 buildings they had raided as a rule were not
	dwellings.   It was now clear that in order to disrupt access to the
	cyberverse, individual &ldquo;users&rdquo; were going to need their
	personal house systems and cyber jacks destroyed.  Cleary was pretty
	sure that such tactics would generate resistance, though just how
	much was unclear.   Already there were some pretty ominous rumors
	circulating about the formation of vigilante groups.  Of course it
	was unlikely that random rag-tag resisters would be able to do much
	against trained, veteran troops organized by a central command
	structure.  But what would happen to their popular support if those
	troops became compelled to gun down citizens defending their homes
	and property?  And what would happen to the solidarity of the
	movement once loss of life inevitably began to occur?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Still, he had to admit that
	neither he nor anyone else in the KOJ had any better ideas at this
	moment.  A second round of attacks against an even longer list of
	targets, each of which was individually less important, wasn't going
	to get them anywhere, even if it, too, somehow went off without
	resistance.  That much at least, was now clear.   Cleary hoped
	desperately that his son could shed some light on what they should
	try next, from his position inside the enemy camp.  But Daniel
	wouldn't be back until the end of the week.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In the old days, to save souls you
	sometimes had to go out door-to-door bearing only a book of
	Scripture and your faith.   So if tomorrow they had to go out
	amongst the unbelievers' houses bearing only faith and high
	explosives, at least the parallel was somehow vaguely comforting.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The brother up front seemed to
	have momentarily run out of steam, so Cleary seized the opportunity
	to thank him for his report, and called for the next item on the
	agenda.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A fair number of
	people had chosen to attend the gathering.  Enough, perhaps, to
	achieve something.  Justin looked around the garden again, noticing
	more new arrivals.  Over there was Stefan, visiting with several of
	his Institute staff, including Temporal Digital Recreation (TDR)
	beneficiaries Craig Stenson and Arturo Scalleni.  Kara Owens was
	there by the fountain, her red hair making her stand out in the
	group, which also included Ray, Marina, and several others whom
	Justin recalled as having been present on the day they'd started all
	of this by Cronus scanning Craig.  Riksana was a little ways away,
	resplendent in a saffron silk dress, chatting animatedly with their
	hosts: Petrov and his stunning Indian wife Shanti.   Petrov's dark,
	brooding visage was positively transformed by a sunburst smile as he
	turned to say something to his wife.  Riksana threw back her raven
	head and laughed at whatever comment he'd made.  Justin was glad to
	see her enjoying herself.  She'd been working so hard of late.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The setting was strange to say the
	least, and had Petrov etched all over it.  A green garden lay at the
	bottom of what looked like a ruined Greek amphitheater, dotted with
	splashing fountains full of white marble statuary ripped straight
	out of Michelangelo.  Grass sprouted out of the cracked stone of the
	amphitheater, which was surrounded by low shrubs and olive trees. 
	The sky was a deep lavender, aglow without any obvious source of
	illumination, like a perpetual twilight.  There were no stars or
	other visible astral bodies, just rocky tors frowning down framing
	the scene.  Nearer at hand, torches on poles amidst the fountains
	and tables of refreshments provided a counterbalancing lighting
	which softened the harsh glamor of the sky and made the colors of
	faces and clothing appear more natural.   The entire effect was that
	of a rocky outpost hung unsupported in space, like an ancient
	blister of civilization still clinging to some remote, forgotten
	asteroid.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Down in the very center, where the
	amphitheater's stage would have been, was a large round table of
	rough wood, ringed with chairs.  Every time he glanced at it, Justin
	got the impression it was larger than before.  Abruptly he realized
	that the number of places was expanding to equal the number of
	guests present.  He couldn't help smiling at the subtle touch there.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">After a few more minutes of
	mingling and greetings, during which nobody else arrived, Petrov
	raised his arms and softly asked people to take their seats.  The
	buzz of conversations petered out as the guests began moving toward
	the conference table.  Riksana's path intersected Justin's and she
	took his hand as they strolled over to take adjoining seats.  The
	mood seemed almost convivial, as if recent events were little more
	than a good excuse for old friends to get together.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">When all were seated and the
	greetings and handshakes had died away, Petrov got to his feet.  He
	stood silently for a few moments, eyes sweeping the gathered Full
	Sings, as if organizing his thoughts, or perhaps trying to gain a
	feel for theirs.  Justin found himself doing likewise.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There were forty-one people
	present.  They represented practically every race, color, and
	ethnicity of the biological human species across six continents, as
	well as a number of hybrid permutations, such as Petrov's own mixed
	Ethiopian and Slavic ancestry.  Being personally acquainted with
	most of them for some years, Justin knew that they also represented
	an equally varied mix of specialized knowledge and professions:
	physicists, artists, architects, business entrepreneurs,
	mathematicians, musicians, engineers, writers, economists,
	cyberneticists, philosophers, biologists, historians, and more.  
	And all of them functioned at an ability level orders of magnitude
	beyond that of biological humans.  If any gathering of beings should
	have the capability of piloting a course through these difficult
	times, surely this one would &ndash; provided that they worked
	together harmoniously, of course.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Suddenly Justin realized that,
	without uttering a word, this fact was exactly what Petrov had
	wanted to communicate.  The looks exchanged around the circle showed
	that the rest of the assembly got the point as well, and a touch
	more solemnity enveloped the gathering.  Having made his opening
	statement nonverbally, Petrov now spoke softly in his light
	baritone, which always sounded rather incongruous emanating from his
	massive frame.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Thank you all for coming. 
	Since it now seems to have become customary to reassure guests as to
	the safety of their virtual hosting, let me assure you that we are
	running here on some of the newest and finest hardware to be found
	anywhere in lunar orbit.&rdquo;  This was received with some light
	laughter.  &ldquo;Before we move on to a discussion of how we can
	best avoid ending up here on a permanent basis, I'd like to ask for
	several of our number to provide some reports &ndash; succinct ones
	&ndash; concerning their work on various projects extending a number
	of frontiers.  First, the man of the hour as it were, the fellow
	whose project proved to be the tipping point which ignited the Mosh
	retro-revolution: I give you Dr. Stefan Jager, Chairman of the
	Archimedes Institute of Temporal Physics, and first chair trumpet on
	the Last Trumpet Project.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov grinned as he sat down,
	while Stefan got to his feet, amid a growing swell of applause. 
	Stefan <I>looked</I> like a stereotypical research scientist:
	balding, bearded, a bit pear-shaped, though of course he wore no
	glasses and was as well dressed and groomed as anyone.  He genuinely
	looked a bit embarrassed at the outpouring of support, which only
	caused it to turn into a standing ovation, as everyone rose to make
	the point that the reactions of a bunch of irate, irrational Moshes
	didn't detract in the least from what was, in fact, quite a
	remarkable achievement.  Stefan stood there looking uncomfortable
	but relieved, and finally had to laugh and take a bow, and then wave
	his arms for silence.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Thank you, friends, for
	your support,&rdquo; he said once everyone was again seated.  &ldquo;That
	means a lot to me, and to all of us on the Cronus Project.  Well,
	what can I tell you?  Petrov requested a brief report, so I'll
	endeavor to oblige.   The Project has now carried out, as of today,
	11,897 successful TDRs, or Temporal Digital Recreations.  These
	represent but a tiny fraction of the more than seven hundred <I>million</I>
	TDR requests which the Institute has so far received.  We have,
	naturally, been laboring hard to increase our processing capacity by
	means of parallelization.  Over the short term, efforts to
	mass-replicate our equipment have reduced our TDR completion rate,
	but we expect to be able to ramp up to about ten thousand TDRs per
	day by the end of the month.  The effective reach of the Cronus
	device back in time has been extended to somewhat more than one
	hundred years, to the first decade of the twentieth century.  It is
	expected that this will soon extend a great deal further, as we
	complete redesigns of some of the focusing hardware.  That
	development will, of course, only serve to boost the anticipated
	number of TDR requests.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As far as impacts from the
	events of six days ago, our systems have not been affected, apart
	from the loss of some older routing hardware, which has already been
	replaced.  Our business planners have successfully developed cost
	estimates and fee schedules for an entire matrix of TDR requests and
	subject hosting arrangements, based on our system redesign and
	replication progress.   We've signed contracts with Petrovmesh,
	Virtutech, and several other virtuality hosting companies to provide
	subject housing.   We have almost two billion yottacalcs of
	processing power on order from various vendors to meet our expected
	future growth curve.  If that sounds like a lot, it is.  The only
	thing that's saving us from bankruptcy is the fact that it can't
	possibly all get delivered at once, especially given the, uh,
	replacement demand that was created last week.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So, I'd like briefly to
	announce that the Institute has spun off a separate business unit,
	Paradise Systems, a cyberverse company limited by shares.  This
	entity will be marketing the Project's TDR services, under exclusive
	license from the Institute.  To raise the needed capital, shares of
	the new company will be offered, starting tomorrow, through private
	placement with purchase via Aurumnet.  Please contact my Paia with
	any inquiries concerning particulars.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I guess that about does it.
	 We are also hiring certain specialists, if any of you happen to be
	looking for work.&rdquo;  Stefan smiled, knowing that wasn't too
	likely in this company.  He took his seat, to a round of
	appreciative murmurs.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov stood up again.  &ldquo;Professor
	Sky, would you like to update us on the Alpha-C Project?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A tall, lithe Amerind woman nodded
	and got smoothly to her feet.  The very appropriately named Starry
	Sky headed a private foundation's team working on launching an
	exploration mission to the Alpha Centauri system.  &ldquo;In view of
	the current circumstances, we've decided to press ahead with the
	launch of the prototype vehicle as early as the middle of next
	month,&rdquo; she said evenly.  Mutters of surprise greeted this
	announcement.  &ldquo;The technical problems of the photonic drive
	have all been resolved, and our remaining hurdle is the patterning
	program.   However, we believe that we can make remote adjustments
	in transit to complete the configuration once the protocol is
	finalized.  Accordingly, there is no real reason to delay the
	prototype's departure.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin knew that such certainty
	could only have come from one source, and resisted looking at
	Riksana next to him.  Petrov, however, did look at her, and called
	on her next as Professor Sky sat down.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana Namoto's team is
	working on a breakthrough in matter patterning, which will be useful
	to us all.  Would you like to give us an update, Riksana?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana sighed and stood up. 
	&ldquo;Certainly.  There are still some areas of feedback
	instability to be worked out.  But the basic protocol is nearly
	complete.   I can't offer you an exact date, but full operability is
	at most three or four months away.&rdquo;  This caused a curtain of
	aghast silence to fall like a blanket over the table.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Are you certain, Riksana?&rdquo;
	Stefan inquired.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Eighty-three point six
	percent certain, yes,&rdquo; she replied with a smile.  There being
	no further questions, she sat down again.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov rose and again swept the
	assembly with his gaze.  &ldquo;I asked these three individuals to
	give us these status reports to illustrate that we stand on the
	threshold of great things indeed.  The Singularity, after all, is
	not an end in itself.  But we also stand on the edge of some peril,
	and to address that topic I'd like to call on Justin Turrell to give
	us his take on the current situation with the Moshes.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin got to his feet, nodded at
	Petrov, and smiled at his assembled peers.  &ldquo;Well, you don't
	need me to tell you that something in this Last Trumpet business has
	struck a chord &ndash; a very dissonant one &ndash; with the Mosh
	religious and political communities.  Which makes it ironically
	fitting that we've been able to use the Cronus Scanner to piece
	together the activities and motivations of the other side.  The
	responsible culprits are &ndash; again, not exactly news &ndash; the
	so-called Order of the Knights of Jesus, and a radical reactionary
	faction within the government of the North American Federation. 
	These groups are headed up by Reverend Maxwell Cleary and Secretary
	of Homeland Security Roger Sarner, respectively.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary's group of fanatics
	has provided both intel and logistical support, and even contributed
	a significant fraction of the commandos who actually carried out the
	3/3 raids.  Sarner and his people have, effectively, executed a
	coup.  It appears that the legitimately elected officials are now in
	&ldquo;protective custody,&rdquo; and are likely to remain there. 
	Government explanations for the events of 3/3 tell only a portion of
	the truth, as is their wont.  They point the finger at religious
	extremist terrorists, but without naming the KOJ explicitly, and
	without admitting their own collusion.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As near as we can
	determine, larger node clusters were targeted based primarily on
	average transmission bandwidth, as far back as six months ago.  In
	each case an access point was prepared secretly, usually via a
	tunnel dug under streets to reach building foundations.  On 3/3,
	commando teams blasted their way into the target buildings, and
	destroyed the equipment there using plastic or chemical explosives. 
	The surreptitious access routes served to conceal the demolition
	activities from public view until the deeds were already done. 
	Emergency response teams were rapidly pulled in too many directions
	to be at all effective.  There was, unfortunately, some resulting
	loss of life.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The targets were selected
	using mesh traffic monitoring performed by the Ferret system, a
	somewhat archaic packet analysis program fed by radio spectrum
	monitors distributed across the continent, linked to a central hub
	in China Lake, California.  A descendant of the Echelon system,
	first deployed by the former United States empire some eighty years
	ago to engage in global espionage, Ferret, in its latest
	incarnation, was a bit more than six years old.  This means that it
	was generally incapable of monitoring those parts of the mesh which
	utilize network frequencies and protocols that came into common use
	since its construction.  Moreover, the poor density of its
	monitoring stations in geostationary orbit resulted in an almost
	complete inability to detect node clusters in earth orbit, lunar
	orbit, on the Moon, or out at Lagrange points.  For that matter, no
	oceanic hubs were targeted, not even those close-in on the
	continental shelf.  I say <I>was</I>, because the government's
	operation inadvertently destroyed their own China Lake central
	facility.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin paused for the expected
	outburst of laughter.  &ldquo;The net result of the 3/3 brain house
	attacks, which were dubbed &ldquo;Operation Skull Fracture&rdquo; by
	Sarner &ndash; evincing his customary brutish glee &ndash; has been
	a seven percent increase in average cyberverse access costs.  This
	rise in price has induced a demand side traffic reduction in excess
	of nine percent.  During the event there were, in fact, numerous
	service disruptions.  There has also been substantial resulting data
	loss.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">However, overall damage to
	the infrastructure of virtuality as a whole was minor, owing to
	several factors.  First, the fact that Ferret's deficiencies
	resulted in targeting primarily older, lower cost, and lower
	technology facilities located only on North American soil.  Second,
	the existence of spare capacity which was able to fill most of the
	service gaps using newer equipment, albeit at higher costs.  Third,
	the redundant and parallel nature of the distributed mesh itself,
	coupled with the practical limitation on the number of targets which
	could be destroyed simultaneously.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What damage there was,
	including the price hikes, should be fully mitigated by the end of
	the month.  Alternative and replacement capacity continues to be
	deployed.  At my suggestion, the Archimedes Institute has generously
	agreed to allocate some Cronus bandwidth to the task of recovering
	the quantscans of each of the 571 destroyed facilities as they
	existed immediately prior to their immolation.  This will allow
	recovery of any lost data, which will then be returned to its
	owners.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There was some appreciative
	applause at this news, which Stefan acknowledged with a nod.  A fair
	number of virtual worlds had been completely destroyed, including
	their backup copies, which to this crowd represented a cultural
	crime almost comparable to the burning of the Alexandrian Library by
	the Romans.  To destroy an entire world, with all its complexity and
	its history and its place in the lives and memories of the people
	who'd created it, who visited and enjoyed it, and who valued it, was
	a crime indeed; and one not lessened by the fact that that world
	might be lower tech, or fallen into desuetude, and thus relegated to
	older hosting hardware.  The senseless and irrevocable destruction
	of created culture was an event to be mourned and deplored.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Moshes have caused a
	great deal less damage than they intended,&rdquo; Justin went on. 
	&ldquo;This is because they fail to understand self-extending,
	decentralized networks, or technological evolution generally
	speaking, or the operation of free markets.  Government types have
	seldom understood these things well, and have usually feared them to
	the extent that they did understand them.  Religious types often
	disdain such things as being too &ldquo;worldly,&rdquo; and
	therefore do not trouble to investigate them thoroughly.  As a
	result, these clueless conspirators managed to convince themselves
	that they were about to deliver a crushing blow to a more advanced
	civilization which they do not even clearly comprehend.  They were,
	quite naturally, mistaken.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Nevertheless I want to
	caution us all against feeling smug or complacent.  Even Moshes can
	learn from their mistakes, and the evidence suggests that they are
	now contemplating actions which may prove even more bothersome over
	the long term.  For example, house-to-house and building-to-building
	sweeps searching out and destroying all computer or network related
	equipment.  The use of military aircraft, ocean craft, and
	spacecraft to attack orbital and ocean-based computing platforms.  
	Orbit ladders around the world make geosynchronous orbit as easy to
	reach for them as for anyone else.   Although contemporary
	molecular, atomic, and quantum computing hardware is essentially
	immune to the effects of electromagnetic pulses, a substantial
	number of nuclear explosive devices, aka hydrogen bombs, are still
	known to exist in the hands of various governments.  They do have
	the theoretical capability to project such payloads even as far as
	the lunar surface.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Moreover, the indications
	are that a corollary wave of Mosh religious and reactionary
	political fervor is sweeping the globe, and is in no way confined to
	the North American territories.   Sympathy and copycat attacks on
	3/3 were very limited, but a rising tide of worldwide
	anti-virtuality violence has already commenced.  We are dealing,
	here, with two primary mindsets: that of political authority, which
	is tired of being marginalized; and that of religious belief, which
	is offended by what it sees as the heretical worship of false gods. 
	Although church and state in recent centuries have frequently found
	themselves at odds, they now find themselves traveling unwillingly
	in the same decrepit boat: sailing to Here-There-Be-Dragons, off the
	edge of their flat earth, into the endless sea of oblivion.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Indeed it is the
	motivations of our Mosh opponents, rather than their actual deeds to
	date, which trouble me most.   In religious extremists like the KOJ,
	we encounter people who genuinely believe that the end times are
	upon us, and who are therefore willing, or perhaps even desire, to
	perish for their faith.  In pro-government extremists, we encounter
	those who still cling to the twisted belief that the exercise of
	authority can improve the world: a fallacious paradigm which
	resulted in the violent deaths of some quarter of a billion human
	beings in the previous century alone, and the needless
	impoverishment and suffering of billions more.  These people, from
	both camps, stand ready and willing to utilize asymmetric tactics
	which do not gain their ends, and could even result in their own
	destruction.  They simply do not care; they are prisoners of their
	own instinctive biological imperatives.  The drive for authority,
	for power, for wealth, is ascribable to the lust for security and
	expanded mating opportunities.  The drive for religious
	justification and redemption is ascribable to guilt, self abnegation
	and contempt.  These are powerful, primal memes, which do not
	commonly conduce rational behavior.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Which brings me to where I
	feel the danger truly lies.  It is not to us, who exist fully on
	higher substrates.  I have no doubt that we can stay ahead of the
	fanatics, and outwit them as required.  By the time they figure out
	where we might be vulnerable today, we could well be established
	three star systems away.   The danger, ladies and gentlemen, is to
	those of our race who are not yet fully virtualized.  The vast
	majority who still have biological bodies, who require immersion
	chambers and mesh jacks to access virtuality, and whose bodies and
	dwellings and personal computing hardware are soon to be at risk.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There is of course no
	reason to suppose that the biological Sings will not resist and
	defend themselves.  Which means that the main risk we face is the
	usual one: civil war.  From our Singularian perspective, all wars
	are civil wars, because they are all internecine within the human
	tribe.  This one could easily prove to be as bloody and destructive
	as those of the past.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">My friends, I believe that
	it is our responsibility, as the highest intelligence that we know
	of, to do what we can to mitigate this violence and strife.  The
	Moshes fear our potential ability to destroy them; and indeed, it
	would be simple to do so.   But on the contrary, I believe that we
	must preserve them.  And yet prevent them, to the extent that we are
	able, from harming those others who are vulnerable to their
	irrational aggression.  If you agree with me in this, then I would
	like to ask each of you to give this matter some thought.  It is not
	retribution that we must seek, but mercy and peaceful coexistence,
	for all our brothers and sisters of the human tribe.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There was no applause, but a
	thoughtful silence.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I would like to point out,
	Justin,&rdquo; Kara offered, &ldquo;that our beloved cyberverse took
	so little damage from this would-be holocaust largely because you
	wrought so well back when you developed the DR.OS Protocols.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Hear, hear,&rdquo; agreed
	several others, and there was another brief round of applause. 
	Justin caught Riksana beaming up at him as she applauded.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Thank you, all,&rdquo;
	Justin acknowledged.  &ldquo;Unfortunately the civil disturbances in
	meatspace are beginning already.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Is there any organized
	resistance yet?&rdquo; asked Starry Sky.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No.  But I expect that it
	will organize spontaneously, soon.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It's a pity we can't induce
	the Moshes to carry the fight into the cyberverse itself, onto our
	turf,&rdquo; Shanti commented.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin concurred.  &ldquo;That
	would be desirable, in that they could find here whatever kind of
	world they wanted, without impinging on other people.  But I fear
	that many of the Moshes, particularly the religious ones, would
	never agree even to consider this, regardless of the circumstances.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What kind of military
	technology is available to the biological Sings?&rdquo; Art Scalleni
	wanted to know.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Potentially, all kinds. 
	Molecular manufacturing can construct weapons as easily as anything
	else, and the digital blueprints are readily available.  I suspect
	the government troops may be in for some surprises.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I sounds to me like the
	formal part of our council is now concluded,&rdquo; Petrov offered. 
	&ldquo;We all know where we stand and what must be done.  I would
	suggest that further discussions need not involve all forty-one of
	us together.  I recommend we practice a little spontaneous order
	here among ourselves, so without objection, let's break this up,
	mingle, and continue the gathering as you please.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No one objected, so everyone rose
	and resumed talking and visiting in smaller groups.  Justin began
	making the rounds again, this time at Riksana's side.  Something in
	the way Petrov had abruptly broken off the formal conference
	suggested to him that his friend had had an idea.  But judging from
	the minimal head shake that Petrov gave him when he saw Justin
	looking at him, he was not yet ready to discuss it.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A man fell,
	screaming, off the corner of a high rooftop.  The scream cut off
	abruptly as his rifle caromed out of his hand at its impact against
	the sidewalk, and clattered back to earth, less broken than its
	owner.  The results were not pretty.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Roger Sarner emerged from where
	he'd been crouching behind a ground car.   He shook his head.  That
	dead bastard there had been sniping at their dynamic entry team as
	they moved to enter the building.   The sniper's opening salvo had
	missed hitting anyone.  Sarner's men, quickly returning fire, had
	not.  Still, that had been disturbingly close.  He'd wondered how
	long it would be before this sort of shit started happening.  Damned
	vigilantes trying to protect what they considered their property.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They had no real chance, of
	course, not here in meatspace where the laws of physical reality
	applied all too strongly.  Like gravity, he mused, watching his men
	check out the fallen sniper.  The medic gestured negatively.  No
	need to expend any more bullets here.  Another trooper picked up the
	damaged rifle and handed it to the boss, as he walked over and
	extended his hand for it.  The trigger guard was mangled and the
	rear sight broken off.  Still, it was salvageable.  Sarner checked
	the mag, was chagrined to notice armor-piercing rounds.  This was a
	fine weapon, not the sort of thing you wanted people outside the
	government to have.  And this was why.  Had that man had more
	practice shooting moving targets at a steep angle in a crosswind,
	let alone smart ammo, he could have killed somebody.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Naturally, the digital particle
	blueprints which would allow ordinary MM units to manufacture
	working copies of guns and ammo such as this were completely
	illegal.  Possession carried a ten year prison sentence.  But that
	sure as hell didn't stop anybody who would actually be willing to
	use such a weapon.  He had to admit that there was just no
	controlling the spread of undesirable information.  Fortunately,
	while Sings could download new skills in their cyberverse worlds, or
	so he understood, it didn't work as well for them when they were
	employing those skills using their real meatspace bodies.  There was
	this little matter of training the neural pathways through
	repetitive practice, which didn't come automatically just because
	someone knew how to fight or shoot in theory.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Despite the fact that this rebel
	dumbshit had failed and gotten himself dead for his trouble, the
	very fact that he was able and willing to attempt such a thing
	disturbed Sarner.   The saving grace was that lone kooks like this
	guy didn't have any real organization.  If a gang of them really got
	together it could spell trouble, though that wasn't likely.  This
	was one sense in which the massive fragmentation of society that
	virtuality had wrought had a real bright silver lining.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There may be more of them,&rdquo;
	he said as he handed the weapon back to the squad leader.  &ldquo;Keep
	an eye out while the other teams are inside.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes, sir.&rdquo;  Three
	more squads, forty-five troopers, now entered the office building. 
	Sarner checked his wrist chronometer.  Nearly noon.  They'd been
	sweeping through downtown LA, hitting some likely looking brain
	house locations, before fanning out into the southern residential
	areas for some more house-to-house sweeps.  In another hour they
	were due to rendezvous with around a hundred more men and start
	moving street-by-street through Torrance.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was slow work.  Painstaking. 
	Each house had to be penetrated and searched.  All computers,
	transmitters, routers, cyberjacks, immersion chambers, and MM units
	on the premises were seized or destroyed.   Destroyed, unless they
	merited special interest.   Any people found on the scene were
	searched and identified, but not harmed or taken into custody. 
	Unless they resisted of course, in which case they were shot. 
	Sarner just didn't have enough holding cells for everybody he might
	want to detain.  Which pretty much compelled him either to let
	people slide, or deal with them in a forthright and final way up
	front.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He'd always found willingness to
	resist to be a good litmus test for deciding which way to go with
	most people.  Almost everybody was steamed at having their homes or
	businesses raided, but most of them were also scared enough not to
	let it show too much.  Those types he always let go after routine
	questioning.  Even most of the ones who dared raise spoken
	objections did so on the basis of some quibble about rights or
	legalities.  These, too, he generally let slide.  Anybody who wanted
	to base a complaint within the framework of the system was all right
	with him, since people like himself controlled that system anyway.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was the ones who didn't care
	about who was invading their homes, who didn't give a rat's ass that
	they were the government, those were the ones who were dangerous. 
	Yet for the most part, those folks held their peace too, at least
	while guns that could be pointed at them were plentiful.  But
	sometimes you could see it in their eyes: the hate, the rage. 
	Sarner always taught his people to offer extra provocation to that
	sort.  Because sometimes they took the bait and did something overt.
	  Which then provided a golden opportunity to cull the herd.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Despite all the training that
	Homeland Security provided to its personnel, sometimes his squad
	leaders got their decisions wrong.  Or worse, refused to make their
	own decisions without consulting superiors.  Just not comfortable
	taking responsibility.  Sarner understood that, damnably
	inconvenient though it was.   He used to be that way himself, a bit.
	 But as he'd gotten more experienced, giving life and death orders
	no longer troubled him the way it used to.  In fact, now that the
	gloves were off so to speak, he found that his sense of duty let him
	do whatever was necessary.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Looking again at the heap of
	broken flesh on the sidewalk that had been a man, Roger reflected
	that he no longer felt incomplete, or starved for something more
	when he came back from a mission.  He realized now that it had been
	his fears about appearances that had held him back from doing all
	that was necessary.  His apprehension about being held to someone
	else's standards of conduct, some spineless nitwit politico's for
	example.  But now he was truly in charge, and thus no longer
	suffered from that debilitating weakness.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He supposed that theoretically, as
	the man effectively in charge of the entire North American
	Federation, he ought to be spending more of his time on big picture
	stuff, rather than leading anti-cyberverse raids in person.  And to
	be sure, there were certain dangers involved in doing so.  But he
	figured that if he put in the street time today, his squad leaders
	would learn from his example and be better able to carry on and do
	their jobs right when he wasn't on the scene.  So that when he had
	to go back and ride herd on the larger effort, things wouldn't stall
	out or take any wrong turns.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The big picture was actually
	pretty exciting.  It turned out that there was plenty of military
	hardware leftover from twenty or thirty years ago.  Stuff like
	bombers and tanks and ships that had been mothballed in dry docks.  
	Once national borders became shockingly indefensible, that kind of
	hardware fell out of use, but some of it was still around and in a
	serviceable condition.  He and Reverend Cleary were recruiting all
	the people they could get to put it back into service.  Soon they'd
	be bombing, torpedoing, and depth-charging offshore brain house
	targets, both on the ocean's surface and on its floor.   He had
	people dusting off old surface-to-air missile systems and learning
	to configure them to go after airborne or even low-orbit targets.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner scanned the clear blue sky
	with his field binocs.   Yes, there.  High over LA were a large
	number of spherical dots.  They were comm buoys, completely
	evacuated spheres made of light nanomaterials so that they floated
	at a certain height far above the ground.  They carried booster
	transmitters which helped cyberverse networks relay signals,
	bouncing them off the buoys to extend line of sight around the curve
	of the earth.   Powered by integrated nanosolar panels that ran
	their transmitters and station-keeping engines, the buoys were
	routers in the sky that could reflect or retransmit electromagnetic
	signals of all kinds, from lasers to microwaves to radio.  Funny
	he'd never thought about it before, but there they were, hovering
	above most cities.  Right now he had pilots training on taking them
	out with air-to-air missiles.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The orbital stuff the Sings had
	would be harder to take out, but there were teams working on that,
	too.  Orbital ladders, nanosteel filaments anchoring an orbital
	platform to the ground with elevator cars traversing up and down the
	cables, provided ready access to low Earth orbit at thousands of
	points around the equator.  The problem was how to take out
	satellites once you had your crews and weapons systems up in orbit. 
	And you had to take out the right satellites.  Human beings had been
	putting stuff into orbit for so long now that it was a helluva
	target-rich environment up there.  Of course, a lot of it was
	derelict technology that nobody had ever cleaned up.  Separating the
	wheat from the chaff, or who the wheat belonged to, was a hard job.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He saw now that their reliance on
	Ferret had blinded them even while it appeared to be helping them. 
	You just couldn't go after a decentralized enemy by looking for
	centralized targets.  There weren't any.  Only a gradual,
	irresistible purge had any hope of working in the end.  Just like
	they were doing now.  In retrospect the destruction of Ferret had
	been a blessing because it had forced them to rework their strategy.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Of course, that still hadn't saved
	the doofus who'd failed to take Ferret Central off the Skull
	Fracture target list.  That individual, a mid-level bureaucrat in
	data processing, had gone to the wall two weeks ago.  Sarner still
	remembered with amusement her tearful pleas to the firing squad. 
	Yeah, right, like the guys weren't gonna shoot 'cause she was a
	woman or something.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">One of the teams was coming back
	out of the office tower now.   From the patches embroidered on the
	collars of their uniforms, he could see that this squad was KOJ.  A
	yellow eye, styled like the one that used to be on the old US dollar
	bill, except lacking the pyramid, adorned the left side of their
	collars.  On the right side was an open book.  The Bible symbolism
	wasn't hard to figure out, but he'd had to ask Cleary what the eye
	was all about.  The Reverend said it was a reminder that the eye of
	God was always watching over their actions.  Fair enough.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He was getting along better with
	the Reverend these days, not because of the officious little twit
	himself so much as because he liked working with the KOJ men
	themselves.  They were dedicated, disciplined, and glad to follow
	orders.  He'd experienced no trouble integrating them with his own
	Homeland Security forces.  Sarner had begun to grasp just how useful
	a religious motivation could be for men with a tough job to do.  He
	found their beliefs interesting.  Now if he could just figure out an
	angle to make them feel more personal loyalty to him, things would
	be perfect.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Nothing but a few old
	office automation computers that haven't been turned on in a long
	time, sir,&rdquo; the squad leader reported.  Damn.  Could someone
	be moving stuff out ahead of them?   This complex had looked like
	such a promising target.  Sarner nodded, pointed across the street
	at a derelict storefront.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That building looks closed
	up pretty tight.  Why don't you go have a quick look while we wait
	for the squads upstairs?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Right, sir.&rdquo;  The KOJ
	sergeant barked orders to his men, who fanned out across the street,
	ready to support the entry team as they planted explosive charges on
	the front door.  After the satisfying bang, the men filed inside,
	weapons out, moving in pairs to cover one another.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner checked his watch again. 
	He really should be back at headquarters masterminding the planning.
	 But they might need him down in Torrance in a bit.   More resisters
	might be found down there.  Some people still had this quaint idea
	about defending their homes like castles.  In which case his team
	leaders were going to need him to set a good example on how to deal
	with resistance.    No, in view of the incident here with the
	would-be rooftop sniper, he couldn't very well bug out early.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The men all came back out of both
	buildings, empty-handed.  Oh well.  Time to move on to fields filled
	with richer game.   &ldquo;Let's move out for Torrance!&rdquo; he
	hollered, holstered his binocs, and headed for his ground car.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A masked woman in
	a white bodysuit fell twisting through the air, continuing the
	motion of her leap off the high balcony.   Even as she plummeted
	toward the street, she brought her weapons to bear on three targets:
	darkly uniformed men with KOJ collar patches, carrying their own
	automatic firearms.  The men reacted a hair too slowly to glimpsing
	her in their peripheral vision, with the result that by the time
	their guns began to swivel in their hands, a fusillade of supersonic
	projectiles was already streaming toward two of them.  The chests of
	those two men imploded, and their bodies settled akimbo on the
	asphalt like dropped puppets, even as the woman landed ten yards
	away.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Gracefully but improbably taking
	the impact shock from the five-story dive in her knees, she bounced
	up off the pavement in a dancer's leap that carried her toward the
	remaining man, rotating in midair to present a more difficult target
	while holstering her sidearms.  The third man discharged his weapon
	frantically in her direction, but aimed too high as she fell short
	and landed in a crouch right in front of him.  Even as he corrected
	his aim and fired again, she deflected his gun barrel aside with one
	hand, drew a long knife with the other, and punched it through his
	throat.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">With a gurgle, the last KOJ goon
	collapsed to the ground, even as his killer relieved him of his
	weapon, spun it around, and gratuitously turned his head into soup
	with a point-blank burst.  Casually discarding the machine-gun, the
	woman retrieved her dagger, wiped it clean on the dead man's
	uniform, and re-holstered it at her waist.  Then she reached up and
	pulled off her white head mask, revealing long black hair tied back
	and a face to stun a man.  She faced back the way she had come,
	expectantly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A male form, similarly clad like a

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay grinned and cuffed her
	playfully on the shoulder.   &ldquo;I did.  Just don't get that
	flashy when we do this for real in meatspace.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Oh, I won't,&rdquo; she
	assured him.  &ldquo;But the point of practicing is to accustom our
	neocortexes to the capabilities we'll have with the full-spectrum
	nanite implants.  You're sure this is an accurate simulation?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Very accurate.  It came
	from the implant manufacturer.  And it's governing our movements
	based entirely on our own unique neocortex activity.  No smoothings
	or approximations local to the virtual environment.  So the
	capabilities we have now are very close to what we'll have in
	meatspace.  I'm having everybody do a few days' worth of training in
	here.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma nodded.  &ldquo;It's

	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Killing people?&rdquo; he
	asked incredulously.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No, silly.  I mean taking
	sixty foot leaps and having the hand-eye coordination to shoot
	accurately while falling.  But I'll do the killing too, when I have
	to.&rdquo;  She waved dismissively at the dead bodies.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'd say these assholes are
	gonna know they were in a fight,&rdquo; Clay agreed grimly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma stepped close to him and put
	an arm around his waist.  &ldquo;It's wonderful what you've put
	together, darling.  I'm proud of you.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay snorted softly and gave her a
	lingering kiss.  &ldquo;I told you I was a marketing guy,&rdquo; he
	said with a smirk.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She had to laugh.  &ldquo;So you
	did.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Still, it amazed Clay some too,
	what had gone down in the past three weeks.  The IADC, officially
	the Irregular Army for Defense of the Cyberverse &ndash; known more
	widely and colloquially as the Cyberantes &ndash; now numbered more
	than twenty thousand top-drawer commandos, with thirty times that
	many support, auxiliaries, and financial supporters.  It had
	recently subsumed four smaller mesh tribes with similar charters. 
	Clay had written the Charter for the IADC tribe himself, with some
	invaluable help from Salma, deliberately couching it in the antique
	language of Jefferson and Paine.  A long train of abuses and
	usurpations, pledging their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor, and
	so forth.   It certainly fit well enough.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yet once he had entered it into
	the tribal search engines, which let people locate others with
	shared interests, the response he got surprised even him.  Although
	only a small percentage volunteered to undertake the radical
	upgrades to their meatspace bodies and extensive training necessary
	to become commandos, many more offered to provide technology,
	resources, money, intel, communications, coordination, medical
	expertise, and support of all kinds.   It was a fortunate
	combination.  The tribe needed the very best in biotech upgrades for
	human bodies, for weapons and body armor, MM factories and supply
	distribution networks, combat training programs like this
	simulation, seamless communications infrastructure, a fleet of
	transports, spy satellite intelligence gathering, and more.  They
	had gotten all of it, and then some.  The Cyberantes tribe had so
	much gold available right now that three days ago Clay had put out a
	bulletin asking members to defer contributions until further notice.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Some of the technology had been
	improved, and in some cases designed from scratch, just during these
	past weeks.  The breakthrough moment had come when Stefan Jager, for
	whom Clay had started working, abruptly reassigned Clay's duties to
	include building up the Cyberantes.   He'd said that someone needed
	to do it, so Paradise Systems might as well pay him to do it full
	time, since he was already doing such a great job.  That endorsement
	had brought some of Stefan's colleagues into the tribe.  And some of
	them were engineers like Clay had never even imagined.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This body armor that he and Salma
	were wearing had been designed and perfected in just ten days.  It
	looked and felt like rough, stretchy fabric, and was just as light. 
	Yet it would turn anything much smaller than an anti-tank round, if
	fired from more than a few dozen yards or at any more than a slight
	incident angle.  Ordinary bullets were iffy even at point blank
	range.  Yesterday, Clay had allowed a percussion grenade to explode
	cupped in his gloved hands.   His hands were forced wildly apart,
	but a faint sting was all the impact that he felt.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Today the elite commandos were
	practicing search-and-destroy tactics, by pairs in urban
	environments.  This simulation he and Salma were in was a randomly
	selected instance of one of several hundred available.   The virtual
	interface had been reconfigured to simulate the precise
	characteristics they'd experience in meatspace using their real
	bodies, calibrating sensory input, reaction times, movement
	capabilities, muscle and skeleton strength, weapons, equipment, and
	probable enemy configurations and tactics, based upon their latest
	intelligence reports.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">An indicator began flashing a
	warning red in the edge of Clay's field of vision, superimposed over
	what he was seeing.  As he focused on the heads-up display it became
	clearer: infrared radar contact, incoming heat signatures that could
	only be human bodies.  He nodded to Salma.  She'd seen it too.  They
	put their ski-mask-like headgear back on, drew their automatic
	weapons, and spread out to opposite sides of the street, facing the
	oncoming signals.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A squad of six more men came
	jogging down the street.  Unlike the first three, these men were
	wearing dark body armor, which had a sculptured ceramic look to it,
	making them resemble superheroes or villains of yore rather than
	sleek ninjas.  Not as good as what Salma and Clay were wearing, but
	still good enough to shed most of their ordinance, unless fired dead
	on at close range.  Clay tripped his stealth mode, telling Salma to
	do likewise with the flick of a thought over their open messaging
	connection.  Instantly his bodysuit began reflecting light to match
	what was behind him.  So long as he faced the hostiles, they would
	see nothing but a faint ripple against the storefront windows behind
	him, and that much only if he moved suddenly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The men started to go past, then
	checked and turned sideways, four of them turning toward Clay and
	two toward Salma, glancing down at their rifles.  Obviously they had
	heat sensor targeting devices.  In that case standing still was not
	the best idea, Clay decided.  He leaped straight up and toward them
	over their heads, taking a trajectory with a much higher vertical
	component than was really necessary, hopefully one much higher than
	the enemy would anticipate.  All four goons facing his way
	discharged their weapons at the blur of motion he left behind in the
	window, tracking upward.  The window shattered, as did the one where
	Salma had been standing, as she imitated his motion.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Her word hissed in his head over
	their message link as he hurtled through the air: &ldquo;Swords.&rdquo;
	 He silently agreed, and was already drawing his as he came down
	almost directly on top of the four men facing his way, but a little
	to one side of them, as his stealth switched off.  His first
	overhand blow, borrowing some of the force of his landing, sliced
	through the rifles of his two nearest opponents.  As they turned
	toward him, he stepped further to the side to put them between
	himself and the other two men whose guns were still intact.  Then he
	pirouetted and skewered the closest man through the eye guard. 
	Clay's nanosteel rapier pierced the weaker transparent plate and
	jerked the man's head back as the visor was opaqued from within by a
	dark red splash.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay saw Salma's blade pass
	exactly through the gap between armor sections on the arm of one of
	the men facing her.  She trimmed his fingernails to the elbow, and
	he let go his weapon with a bellow of pain.   Clay pushed the man
	he'd just killed backward into his fellows, simultaneously
	retrieving his sword point.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Whether by accident or out of
	panic, the fourth man at the back of the column facing Clay opened
	fire, straight into his nearest buddy's back.  Clay dove forward and
	to the side, and cut at the knee joint of the next man, who was
	spinning to get out of the way of the falling dead weight of one
	comrade and the friendly fire of the other.  The impact drew blood
	and staggered the man, but Clay's stroke angle hadn't been as
	perfect as Salma's and the slash did not harvest a limb.  The fellow
	who'd been shot full of lead in the back screamed explosively as he
	dropped his weapon and then crumpled.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A vicious uppercut slash from
	Salma bereft her second opponent of his rifle, whereupon she
	reversed her sword, leaned in, and slammed him in the face with the
	pommel.  He rocked backwards and stumbled.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Releasing his sword, Clay leaped
	up and grappled with the desperate shooter for possession of his
	gun, even as he was swiveling it Clay's way, still firing.  The
	shots flew over Clay's shoulder, pummeling the stone facade of the
	building behind him till it almost disappeared in a cloud of rock
	chips and shrapnel.  With a spasm of superior strength, Clay was
	finally able to wrench the weapon away.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As he did so, he saw Salma deliver
	an elegant two-handed swipe to the neck of her staggered opponent as
	he struggled groggily up off his knees.  This time her trajectory
	was not quite perfect, and the blade hung up on his armor above his
	collarbone, and rang as it stopped &ndash; but on the far side of
	his neck.  As she wrenched it back out, his head flopped bonelessly
	to that side, revealing shattered white vertebrae quickly painted
	over with fountaining gore.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay tripped his now disarmed
	opponent and treated him to about fifty rounds from his own gun
	fired right into his face plate as he lay on the ground.  That left
	only the man with one arm, and the one with a lamed leg.  The former
	now had a pistol aimed at Salma.  As she turned toward him, she
	threw her saber and drew both automatics.  He got off several wild
	shots before the flying sword arrived at his hand and knocked his
	aim aside.  Walking calmly toward him, she opened up with both
	weapons in parallel.  At about eight feet away the bullets suddenly
	started to penetrate his armor and he did a mad spastic dance, then
	dropped.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The final trooper was crawling on
	his side, unable to walk.  He had started to crawl away
	instinctively, then realized he should be crawling toward a weapon. 
	He'd almost reached the one dropped by the man who'd been riddled in
	the back, but froze when he saw Clay's attention transfer to him. 
	Clay shook his head minimally, dropped the gun he was holding, and
	drew his own.  He walked over to the last of the six, and gestured
	for him to remove his helmet and face guard.  The man complied,
	revealing a sweating face drawn in a rictus of pain as he clutched
	his damaged knee.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Prisoner,&rdquo; Clay
	stated, as Salma walked over to stand next to them.  The trooper
	nodded, did not resist as Salma relieved him of his sidearm and belt
	knife.  &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; Clay went on, &ldquo;that's enough
	for the time being.  Freeze simulation.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Everything around them froze into
	still life, though Clay and Salma could still move.  For a moment
	they surveyed the tableau they had wrought together, and exchanged a
	long glance.  It was a sobering thought to be a killing machine, to
	realize that they could now commit violence like this in real space.
	 And even more sobering to realize that they might have to.   They
	were not proud of it; but still, it represented a rite of passage of
	sorts.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">By silent agreement, they zoned
	out.</FONT></DIV>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was just
	intolerable.   This kind of thing was not supposed to happen.  But
	he wasn't sure what if anything he could do about it, all by
	himself.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Senator Robert Reynolds sat at his
	holo-console in the underground office where he'd been moved for
	&ldquo;security.&rdquo;   That office lay deep in a bunker located
	somewhere on the outskirts of Helena, Montana.  Reynolds had never
	heard of this facility before, had had no idea it even existed. 
	Sarner's people were everywhere.  They looked after his welfare and
	wants most solicitously, but there was absolutely no mistaking the
	fact that he was, essentially, a prisoner.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">By only his second day here it was
	also obvious to him that he was receiving filtered reports of events
	in the outside world.   A little judicious experimentation with his
	outgoing messages quickly demonstrated that the filter was working
	in both directions.  If Sarner was keeping the elected officials
	isolated, including the President, and redacting their
	communications with the world and each other, that could only add up
	to one thing: the Homeland Security Secretary had taken over control
	of the Federation.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Which in turn suggested that
	Sarner's people were actually complicit in the horrific events of
	the third of March.  And that implied that Sarner had made some kind
	of alliance with Reverend Cleary and his fanatics.  Some banter he'd
	overheard amongst the bunker staff provided corroboration, if you
	listened between the lines a little bit.   These people sneered at
	the KOJ sect's fanaticism some, but they didn't consider them as
	enemies.  That gave the lie to the cover stories disseminated in the
	press about the KOJ having caught the government flat-footed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Official embarrassment always led
	to a desire on the part of officials to get even.  The fact that the
	Homeland Security bunch evidenced no genuine need to go out and
	stick it to the KOJ testified eloquently to their having been in it
	with them from the beginning.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Which had left Reynolds uncertain
	as to where to turn.  Communicating openly with the other members of
	Congress or the President was plainly out of the question.   His
	captors were being pleasant only because he was acting as stupid as
	Sarner obviously believed him to be.  If he tipped his hand, they
	would watch him even more carefully, or worse.  Up to now he'd
	played along acting as if he believed that the danger from KOJ
	terrorists was real and the Federation government was the only
	viable means of rounding them up and stopping them.  He knew Sarner
	was getting mileage out of that, and it galled him.  But now it
	looked as if the pretense was about to be dropped, and that worried
	him.   Sarner's men had started going house-to-house through urban
	neighborhoods, destroying cyberverse equipment themselves.  Publicly
	these raids were still being blamed on the KOJ, but the authorities'
	total inability to do anything to halt them was straining credulity,
	even in the unimaginative courtesan press.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In the past month it seemed he'd
	worked out a hundred schemes for getting somebody outside to
	understand exactly what was going on, and he'd reluctantly discarded
	them all.   Any message plain enough to do the job was bound to be
	intercepted and &ldquo;edited,&rdquo; to say nothing of tipping off
	his captors that he was not the stooge they thought him.   So for a
	long time he pondered saying something subtle, via innuendo, to
	someone who knew him well enough to detect it.  But unfortunately,
	all of the people who fell into that category were colleagues who
	were in no position to help him, being in much the same
	circumstances as himself.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Actually, there <I>was</I> one
	person who might be able and willing to help: Justin Turrell.  The
	trouble there was that Justin was very much the enemy that the
	government was working against for real, and anything Reynolds put
	in a message to him would undoubtedly be scrutinized very carefully.
	 In fact, it likely would never even get delivered.  Unless, of
	course, it said something Sarner might want Justin to hear.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So today Reynolds had constructed
	a very carefully worded appeal to Justin to suggest a meeting, in
	the flesh in meatspace, as they had done before.  Clearly they had
	some business of mutual advantage to discuss, regarding the
	suppression of the KOJ forces who were afflicting the cyberverse and
	the Sings.  Reynolds was willing to bet that Sarner wanted to get
	his hands on Justin badly enough that he might just let the message
	go through.  Though naturally he wouldn't expect Justin to accept. 
	Neither did Reynolds.  Presumably the Sing ambassador knew what was
	really going on well enough to suspect that the invitation was a
	trap.  Still, it was the best idea the senator could come up with.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Since there would probably be no
	reply or future dialog, he had to embed whatever else he wanted to
	tell Justin inside this one message.  The other day it had occurred
	to him how he might achieve that.  The people Sarner would have
	monitoring his communications would be Moshes, because that was all
	Sarner really trusted.  He wouldn't have an automated scanning
	system do the job; it would be some of his captors right here in the
	bunker.  Which meant that Reynolds need only put something in the
	message which Justin could detect but Sarner's eavesdroppers would
	not.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">One of the benefits of studying
	legislative history as thoroughly as he had done was that he knew a
	lot about obscure laws which had been enacted in the past.  In the
	USA, many years ago, before there was even an internet, some laws
	had been passed by Congress forbidding something called subliminal
	advertising.  This involved written words or images which flashed by
	too fast to register in the conscious mind of the viewer, but which
	lodged in the subconscious.  Reynolds was reasonably confident that
	a Full Sing would be able to pick out such a subliminal subtext. 
	Still, he had to be careful in case his watchdogs did too.  Clearly
	the subliminal message itself had to look innocuous in case it was
	discovered.  To say nothing of the fact that there was surely an
	audio bug planted here in his office.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Finally, he'd hit upon the answer.
	 More than two decades ago, his wife Marguerite had insisted that he
	learn sign language. They'd studied and practiced it together. 
	Given the existence of ubiquitous automatic language translation
	devices, which could provide written subtitles on the world for
	anybody, learning sign was quaint and old-fashioned even then. 
	Today hardly anyone would know it, or even recognize it for what it
	was.  Justin might not know it either, but he would at least
	recognize it, and could probably look it up and teach it to himself
	in minutes.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So all day today Reynolds had sat
	in front of his console, painstakingly editing an overt message to
	Justin.  He made sure to gesture and fidget with his hands and
	fingers a lot as he recorded takes.   Independently, he recorded a
	silent second message, all in sign.  Then he extracted significant
	single frames out of the covert message and inserted them within the
	longer message at random intervals.   </FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As he played back
	the finished take, Reynolds looked anxiously for any sign of flicker
	or jumping that was perceptible to his senses.  But at one hundred
	frames per second, he couldn't detect any.  Satisfied, he deleted
	the covert message.   Then with a weary sigh, he signed and
	encrypted the vidmail, and sent it off to Justin's coordinates &ndash;
	fully aware that his signing key was compromised by Sarner's people,
	and that therefore only they, and Justin, would be able to view its
	contents.  Encrypting important messages was standard practice, and
	outwardly Reynolds maintained the appearance of belief that his
	encrypted data was secure.  However, the government's insistence
	that it set a good example for the public by exclusively using
	ciphers which supported a key escrow system, guaranteed that it was
	not.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The public had always rejected key
	escrow schemes, out of innate distrust for the escrow custodians &ndash;
	particularly when those worked for the government.  While the
	government had always maintained that if you had nothing to hide,
	you had no reason to object to key escrow.  Thinking of Roger
	Sarner, Reynolds was now forced to admit that the public had been
	right.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The senator rose from his desk,
	finding no need to pretend that he was worn out.  He called a weary
	but cheerful good night to his supposed &ldquo;secretary&rdquo; that
	had been assigned to him, out in the outer office, and received a
	muted, distracted, and mostly unintelligible response.  Reynolds
	walked down the carpeted hall toward his own spacious and
	comfortable underground apartment.  Inside, he got ready for bed
	immediately.   Lights off, he lay in the dark letting his secret
	message play over and over in his head, seeing the hand signs in his
	mind's eye, imagining Justin watching it with comprehension.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif"><I>Justin: I'm captive in a
	HS facility near Helena.  Other officials captive too.  We are kept
	separated and our communications are watched.  Sarner is working
	with the KOJ.  Please ignore main message.  Any such meeting would
	be a trap.  But if you can spring me, I will denounce Sarner.  That
	should help take the pressure off and weaken him.  I fear he is
	going to escalate.  May even go for nuclear option.  Too many old
	weapons still around.  I hope we can help one another.  Hope you're
	well.  Best.&rdquo;</I></FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Feeling more hope and less despair
	than he had in some time, Senator Reynolds fell into fitful sleep.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara walked
	briskly down the darkened street, senses alert, though her mind was
	preoccupied with anticipation concerning the meeting that was about
	to occur.  She wasn't expecting trouble here in town.  But if any
	found her, she was prepared.  She was packing, and had been
	practicing assiduously with her Cyberantes squad.   The evening was
	cool and moist, effects leftover from the afternoon's rain, though
	the night sky was mostly clear.  Hard to believe it was already the
	first week of April.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The air taxi had dropped her off
	in an empty lot a few blocks from her destination, which was a
	small, intimate club she'd been to a number of times before during
	the seven plus years that she'd lived on the outskirts of this
	little town.  She was going there to meet Torch, in the flesh, for
	the first time.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Her emotions were mixed, to say
	the least.   On the one hand it was very moving that her guy wanted
	to get to know her so completely and thoroughly.  On the other,
	there was something almost creepy about the idea that her meatspace
	body and persona was the real her.  Yet that was the sense that she
	got from Torch, that he cared about her so much that he just had to
	get to know the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Cylara.  Flattering and vaguely
	disturbing at the same time.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">How exactly was this any more real
	than myriad places they'd met before?  It certainly wasn't more
	upscale.  The little club was in sight now, just down the block and
	across the street.  Its sign was lit, so it must be open.  Which was
	a good thing: it had been more than two years since she'd last
	visited the place, and a lot of meatspace businesses were vanishing
	these days.   There was no ground car traffic, so she simply steered
	diagonally across the street toward the door, her heels tapping
	steadily across the fraying pavement.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She pulled open the door, entered,
	and unwrapped her scarf as she stood at the front.  The place was
	dim, like she remembered it, all the paneling and tables made of
	dark wood.  Booths lined the walls surrounding the open dance floor.
	 There were also cafe tables and a long, polished wooden bar ringed
	with stools.  A couple of the booths were occupied and a few folks
	sat at the bar, but the establishment was far from busy.   Light
	flooded from the kitchens in back, partially blocked by a set of
	swinging doors.  Canned music was playing, not too loud; evidently
	there would be no live music tonight.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara moved to take a seat at the
	bar, far enough away from any of the other patrons to avoid the
	appearance of inviting conversation.  The bartender looked vaguely
	familiar to her, a well-muscled black dude with a shaved head.   He
	smiled at her and swiped the bar in front of her with a damp cloth.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What'll it be?&rdquo; he
	asked, and at the sound of his voice she recognized him, though his
	head had not been shaved the last time she'd seen him.  On that
	occasion, two and a half years ago, she'd let him pick her up and
	gone home with him when the club closed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She returned his smile coolly. 
	&ldquo;White Russian for now.  I'm expecting a friend to join me.&rdquo;
	 Best to head off any expectations he might be forming, and put any
	patrons who were listening on notice too.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He smiled again, nodded, prepared
	her drink.  &ldquo;Five hundred ameros,&rdquo; he said as he served
	it to her.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara was a bit taken aback.   On
	her way out of the house, she'd raided her desk for all the
	meatspace money it had contained, which came to about eight
	thousand.  Two years ago that would have bought rounds for a packed
	house, many times over.  Damned government paper currency, what a
	waste.  And these were what, new new ameros, second revaluation?  
	Must be time for a third.  She took a one thousand amero note out of
	her purse and handed it to him, and he made her change.  If Torch
	planned to order food, she hoped he brought money of his own.  The
	circumstance of being in a club, feeling antsy and with limited
	resources, suddenly struck her as amusing.  Page from the album of
	her youth.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The White Russian was good,
	tasting just as it did in any decent simulation.  She had to
	remember though that too many of these would impair her brain
	function, unless she explicitly instructed her nanites to clear it. 
	Maybe it was just as well that inflation had made her poor.  She'd
	come here to meet her lover, not get drunk with him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not many sips into her drink the
	front door opened, and a man walked in.  He had dark brown hair,
	green eyes, strong, chiseled features, and was wearing dark jeans
	and a forest green turtleneck, with a worn but stylish black leather
	jacket over all.  Which meant that this had to be Torch himself,
	based on the description he'd given her.  He looked around and
	quickly spotted her, &ldquo;the blond in blue at the bar,&rdquo; and
	walked over with a smile.  She waved, picked up her drink, and slid
	off her stool onto her feet.  She had no intention of trying to hold
	a private conversation sitting at the bar.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They met for a brief one-handed
	embrace as they said hello, then headed straight for an empty corner
	booth in the back.  As they got situated facing one another, Cylara
	experienced a moment of uncharacteristic nervousness.  Somehow this
	was awkward, despite how well they knew each other.   Torch covered
	one of her hands on the table with one of his and squeezed it gently
	as they looked into each other's faces.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Wow, Cy, you're as gorgeous
	in real life as your virtual self,&rdquo; he complimented.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She made herself laugh.  &ldquo;I
	told you I was.  You're not bad looking yourself.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He smiled, released her hand. 
	&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So, you want to order
	something?  I better warn you, this drink here cost me a sixteenth
	part of all the meatspace money I have in the world.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch laughed.  &ldquo;They'll
	take cyberverse money, you know.  Aurumnet if nothing else. 
	Everybody has to these days.  Anyway, not to worry, I've got
	plenty.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Good.  So what are we doing
	here, Torchy?  We could have met anywhere else, so why here?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A waiter appeared at their elbows
	with menus, so they took a moment to order some food.  As the waiter
	retreated, Cylara looked meaningfully at her boyfriend, referencing
	the question still hanging.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I told you why.  Because I
	love you and I want to get better acquainted with you.  All of you.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She shrugged.  &ldquo;The only
	part of me you don't know yet is this body.  And as you've already
	noticed, it's not that different.  I haven't been another person
	with you, lover, just because I could have.  You already know the
	real me, as well as anybody does.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But when you love someone
	Cy, you want to know all about them.  Not just what they look like,
	but where they live, how they dress, how they move and speak, the
	things they like, where they grew up, who their friends are, their
	family, their hobbies, their pets.  I want to know how you live in
	real life.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well to begin with, I don't
	spend much time in real life these days.  I don't like it as well. 
	It's so plain and unchanging.  Too boring, a bit depressing
	actually.  And you already know quite a few of my friends and some
	of my family.  I don't have any pets, unless you count my mining
	robot.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch grinned.  &ldquo;Don't you
	think you can tell a lot about somebody, from where and how they
	live?  I mean, from their chosen surroundings?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But I barely live there. 
	Just ask Paia.  I haven't changed anything in years.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'd still be curious to see
	your place.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara awarded him a measuring
	glance.  Abruptly, she opened her coat and pushed it back off her
	shoulders, shrugged out of it, and straightened her dress.  She was
	wearing a dark blue satin number, with a neckline so plunging that
	it looked like the dress didn't even start in front until it reached
	the bottom half of her bustline.  Cylara's breasts were not huge,
	but well-supported from beneath in a demi-bra, they tautly filled
	the top of her dress and formed impressive, deeply sculpted cleavage
	that swelled gently with her breathing.  The dress tapered out of
	sight below the table to her trim waist and firm, curving hips.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Is this what you're really
	curious to see, darling?&rdquo; she asked after she'd let her impact
	register for a few moments.  &ldquo;Are you working up to suggesting
	that you come home with me, so that you can nail me to my mattress
	in the flesh?  If so, you can be more direct.  You know this body is
	already yours.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch, his mouth suddenly dry,
	pretended nonchalance.  &ldquo;Well, I did have that in mind for
	later, I'll admit.  But really, I just wanted to find out what
	you're like in real life.  To see if you're really still you, I
	guess.  Somebody I'd love, as a woman, the way it used to be.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara ran both hands through her
	hair, bending forward for a moment as she did so, then sat abruptly
	back up straight and shook her hair from side to side, making an
	exasperated noise.  &ldquo;You frustrating humanoid.  I can't
	understand why.  It's not like we're ever going to live together in
	meatspace.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch did not reply for a moment. 
	For one thing, in bending over she'd flashed him her magnificently
	erect nipples.  For another, he wanted to frame his response
	carefully.  For a third, the waiter was approaching with their
	order.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As they tucked into their full,
	steaming plates, everything was of course delicious.  Naturally the
	club staff did not do any cooking; they merely operated MM units in
	the back, which swiftly turned out perfect replicas of meals
	originally scanned from the finest creations of master chefs. 
	Around a mouthful of stuffed veal cordon bleu, Torch offered his
	answer.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I can imagine circumstances
	where we might have to live together in meatspace.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You can?  Such as?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What if the cyberverse was
	destroyed?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara put down her fork and
	downed the rest of her drink from the bar, giving him an incredulous
	look.  &ldquo;How could that possibly happen?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He shrugged.  &ldquo;The
	government and the KOJ.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They won't win.  Their
	little reign of terror is about over, in fact.  You've joined the
	Cyberantes too.  You know what we're going to do to them next time
	they try something.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I know.  But what if they
	resort to nuclear or biochem weapons of mass destruction?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well then meatspace is the
	last place we could live.  It'd be poisoned.  We'd probably have to
	become Full Sings.  Or die, and hope we get restored by the Last
	Trumpet gang.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch shook his head.  &ldquo;I'm
	not sure I'd want that.  Does your soul go with you when you get
	Scanned?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You said something like
	that to Art when we met him.  I'd like to know what evidence you
	have for the existence of this soul thing, or why you seem to
	believe in it.  Because I know I don't.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I guess you can't prove it.
	 It's just an article of faith, I suppose.  Faith is the evidence of
	things not seen.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sounds more like the
	ability to believe in things you know are not true.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch chuckled.  &ldquo;I suppose
	it depends on your point of view.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Only if your point of view
	doesn't care about factual evidence.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Don't you think there's
	more to life than scientific truth?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara thought for a moment,
	taking a mouthful of food to fill the pause.  &ldquo;Of course there
	is, if you mean feelings, such as love.  Life isn't all cold
	rationality.  We'd never enjoy it, no matter how smart we became.  
	But I don't think that means that you can just opt to abandon all
	logic and evidence and believe whatever you decide to believe.  The
	evidence is, that people like Art are fully complete beings.  They
	possess everything that could possibly be included in the definition
	of a 'soul'.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm not sure I agree.  But
	we needn't fight about it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I don't want to fight at
	all.  I guess if we're supposed to get better acquainted, we could
	do that.  I was born in Serbia in 2002.  My mother was American, and
	things weren't good in the old country then, so we moved to the US
	when I was two.  I grew up in Fresno, California.  I was a
	moderately successful fashion model, later a fashion designer.  As
	you know I still do design for a living.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">My God, you're
	forty-three,&rdquo; he laughed.  &ldquo;I'm only twenty-six.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara had to roll her eyes and
	laugh too.  &ldquo;What difference does that make, anymore?  We'll
	both live for centuries.  As long as we want to, really.   And it's
	not like I'm going to get old on you.  You think you can find a
	twenty year-old girl somewhere with a hotter body than I've got?&rdquo;
	she asked with a mischievous widening of the eyes.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch grinned.  &ldquo;Not bloody
	likely, baby.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Right answer.  One thing
	I'm curious to know about you, I have to admit.  Your real name.  I
	mean, your nickname is all about your flaming ginger hair, and yet
	here you don't even have red hair.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I thought about dyeing it
	for you,&rdquo; he confessed, and took another bite off his plate. 
	&ldquo;Daniel,&rdquo; he said after he swallowed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She raised an eyebrow.  &ldquo;Oh,
	really?  I have a cousin and a brother-in-law who are both named
	Daniel.  Not sure I'll get used to that easily.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'd just as soon you
	didn't, actually.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What, the guy who wants to
	know all about the truth of my real existence, prefers to go by an
	assumed name?&rdquo; she said, teasing.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You can call me Daniel when
	we get together here.  When we meet up in the cyberverse, I prefer
	Torch.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara stirred her remaining food
	around with her fork.  &ldquo;Lover, we're going to finish our meal,
	maybe have a dance or two, then catch a taxi to my place.  I'm going
	to unleash this forty-three year old sex-goddess body to screw your
	brains out, then we're going to catch some sleep.  In the morning
	we'll go our separate ways, and we'll continue our relationship in
	virtuality.  So I guess I'll be continuing to call you Torch. 
	Please understand, I'm just not interested in a meatspace boyfriend.
	  I spend most of my time in the cyberverse and that's where I want
	to be with my guy.  It has just so much more to offer.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">For a heartbeat Daniel looked
	rueful, but then brightened and spread his hands in a gesture of
	agreement.  &ldquo;Sure, that's fine.  I always enjoy our time
	together, too.  I just felt I had to see you, once.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She smiled.  &ldquo;You can do
	more than just see,&rdquo; she said, and rose fluidly from their
	booth, took his hand, and led him onto the dance floor just as a
	slow song was beginning.  Soon they were standing entwined, more
	rocking and shifting than dancing.   Cylara slowly rubbed the top of
	her right thigh against the crotch of his jeans.   Daniel gave a
	slightly nervous chuckle.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm afraid I'm not quite
	as... well, not in real life,&rdquo; he said a little sheepishly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She laughed and hugged him harder.
	 &ldquo;You think I am?  That's one thing I had to adjust slightly
	on my virtual self.  You guys with your avatars!  It would be
	uncomfortable otherwise.&rdquo;  He had to laugh too, and spun her
	around for a playful dip.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Before long, they both wanted to
	head out.  Daniel took care of the bill, pulling out an amero
	payment card.  Cylara was impressed in an odd way; hardly anybody
	carried official bank cards anymore.  The bartender had to rummage
	under the bar for their reader machine, and boot it up.  He gave
	Daniel a calculating look, though whether because of his choice of
	tender or because Daniel was plainly taking his one-time bedmate
	home, wasn't obvious.  Soon they were in an air taxi, rapidly
	covering the dark twenty-plus miles to Cylara's house.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">When they arrived, for a moment
	Cylara feared he was going to ask for a guided tour of her home, but
	he had the good sense not to.  Instead she gave him a guided tour of
	every delicious inch of her body.  The sex was hot but in truth not
	as good as what they typically shared in their virtual avatars, for
	either of them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Afterward, as they lay
	companionably in her big four-poster king size bed, Daniel drifted
	off to sleep first, leaving his lover musing in a twilight state. 
	She thought how odd it was to be sharing this room and this
	particular bed with a man, even with this man.  She wondered whether
	she'd ever do it again.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch's insistent interest in a
	having a girlfriend in meatspace, coupled with his pessimism about
	the future of the cyberverse, remained vaguely troubling to her. 
	Was one of them a result of the other, and if so which?  And where
	did he get this penchant for irrational, unsupported belief in
	things like souls?  Childhood upbringing?  It was the sort of thing
	one would expect from some ultra-conservative Mosh.  Yet she knew
	Torch wasn't like that.  His body was almost as cybernetically
	upgraded as hers was.  He too lived mostly in the cyberverse.  He
	was clearly no Mosh.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was a puzzle.  But then, quite
	frankly she was frequently a puzzle to herself.  She could ponder it
	all later.  Right now, sleep beckoned her sated body.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The heat
	shimmered over the quiet Las Vegas side street, despite the fact
	that it was still only early April.  Bright afternoon sun baked the
	exterior of the large beige vehicle parked at the crumbling curb.  A
	combination air and ground vehicle, a solar-powered hybrid the size
	of an antique motor home, it served as a mobile nanoclinic. 
	Customers seeking the services of its proprietors were given its
	current GPS coordinates and made their way to points nearby via
	robotic air taxi.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Business was slow today.  In the
	three and a half hours the vehicle had been parked there, no more
	than a handful of customers had approached.  Perhaps the heat of the
	day was keeping the client&egrave;le away.  Vegas natives frequently
	preferred to defer their business until after sundown.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A large group of men in dark
	clothing appeared around the corner, moving in step together like
	marching soldiers.  These guys did not look at all like prospective
	clients.  Despite this, when they noticed the parked clinic, they
	changed course slightly to move directly toward it.  The men began
	moving double time, fanning out into two groups of about a dozen
	each so as to approach the vehicle from both sides.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">One of the staff looked out a
	window to investigate the sudden surge of blips on their proximity
	detector screen and saw the approaching squads.  Her eyes widened
	and she called out: &ldquo;Trouble, Tim!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What's up Bianca?&rdquo; 
	Tim queried, sticking his bald, tattooed head up the stair from
	below where he had been walking past.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Troopers incoming, looks
	like feds.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Shit!&rdquo; Tim said with
	feeling, and disappeared, running for the control cockpit.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Bianca called down the passageway
	after him: &ldquo;They're all armed!  They'll shoot us up if you try
	to take off.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm not taking off, I'm
	hitting the distress beacon,&rdquo; Tim hollered back over his
	shoulder.  Moments later, a determined, rapid pounding began on the
	exterior door.  Someone knocking without pausing to wait for an
	answer, keeping up a steady, authoritative barrage.  Bianca crept
	downstairs and Tim met her returning.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We have to open up,&rdquo;
	she said calmly.  &ldquo;They'll just blow the door if we don't.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yeah,&rdquo; Tim agreed,
	and moved to do so.  The instant he touched the control and the door
	slid open, about ten dudes surged inside, automatic weapons at the
	ready.  Tim and Bianca were down on the floor in hammerlocks in
	seconds while other men spread out fore and aft, practically
	sprinting, covering each other in pairs as if they expected to find
	hidden opponents, barking at each other in loud, adrenaline-charged
	voices.  There was no one inside but the two staff members, who were
	soon out kneeling in the sunlight with a dozen guns trained on them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The commander came over and looked
	at their IDs, as these were handed to him by another man who had
	just filched them out of their pockets.   The officer, wearing
	captain's bars and unfamiliar yellow logos of some kind on either
	side of his collar, scanned the cards and scrutinized the display in
	his palm for only a few moments.  &ldquo;Illegal nanoclinic, eh?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There's nothing illegal
	about it, we have a franchise charter, it's on the wall right by the
	door,&rdquo; Tim said with unfeigned exasperation.  The captain
	gestured, and one of the men rapped Tim smartly in the back of the
	neck with his rifle butt, and he pitched forward with a groan.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You're behind the times,&rdquo;
	the captain said cuttingly.  &ldquo;You make people into monsters. 
	That's illegal now.&rdquo;  Bianca looked up at him with slitted
	eyes and a hateful expression.  She was a tiny thing, barely five
	foot, with shoulder length brown hair.   More than one of the
	troopers had already noticed the nicely rounded shape of her petite
	frame.  Her fierce, defiant expression told the captain everything
	he needed to know about her attitude.  An unrepentant sinner. 
	Shame.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cuff him,&rdquo; he
	ordered.  &ldquo;As for her, escort her back inside and a couple
	three of you take the sass out of her.&rdquo;  The men chortled as
	they wrestled Bianca back to her feet.  With a snarl and a
	demonstration of remarkable augmented strength, she wrenched her
	wrist free and stiff-armed the man standing in front of her.  He
	flew backward nearly ten yards and landed on his ass with a woof. 
	Four others jumped her from all sides, wisely lifting her off her
	feet to break her leverage.  Even then her lashing limbs
	administered plenty of bruises until one of them bashed her upside
	the head with his rifle butt, hard.  Almost out, blood streaming
	into her eyes and roaring in her ears, Bianca could only twitch
	feebly as they flung her back onto the floor of the clinic where she
	worked.  A certain numbness began to enfold her as they stood her up
	against an interior wall.  Vaguely she heard the sounds of her
	clothing ripping, amid vicious laughter, but she couldn't feel it. 
	She heard what sounded like Tim's voice screaming in the distance,
	suddenly cut off.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A series of sharp reports sounded,
	outside, followed by more screams and yells.  Abruptly she was no
	longer being propped up, and slid to the floor, semi-conscious. 
	After a moment she managed to roll onto her back, and lay looking at
	the ceiling, which swam dizzily in her vision.  A wave of nausea
	rolled over her and she had to close her eyes tight to shut out the
	spinning.  More loud reports.  Gunshots?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And still more yelling.  Urgently
	shouted commands, curses.  More bursts of what she realized now must
	be gunfire.  Faint vibrations in the metal floor beneath her, a hiss
	like air from somewhere.  Still struggling to find her center
	against the vertigo, she opened her eyes.  Daylight leaked onto the
	floor from a dozen point sources in the walls, which had not been
	there before.  God, they must be shooting through the vehicle, she
	realized sluggishly, and managed to roll onto her side, facing the
	open door.  She couldn't see anyone, but there were still occasional
	shots and cries outside.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">After another minute or two of
	deep breaths to collect herself against the nausea, Bianca succeeded
	in crawling across the floor so she could look out.  Two troopers in
	dark uniforms lay on the ground in her field of vision.  One was
	groaning, the other was still.  Tim lay on his back, eyes wide,
	staring straight up at the sky.  His mouth was open but he wasn't
	shouting now.  A scarlet pool framed his bald head on the pavement. 
	<I>Oh, God</I>.  She tried to crawl to him, but as soon as she
	attempted to get up on all fours the disorientation overcame her
	again and her arms collapsed under her.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Abruptly a gloved hand, light but
	strong, was touching her head, then turned her over on her back
	again.  She gaped up at a slight figure in some kind of white
	bodysuit, holding a weapon that faintly trailed smoke and radiated
	heat.   Bianca felt confusion, wasn't sure whether she ought to be
	afraid.  She tried to wipe the blood out of her eyes to see better,
	but had trouble getting her hand to the right spot.  The white
	figure peeled off its mask to reveal the face of a woman:
	dark-haired, olive-complected, rather plain, mid to late thirties.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You're safe,&rdquo; she
	told Bianca.  &ldquo;We're Cyberantes.  Do you have a medical kit?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Bianca's first hazy thought was
	that that was a dumb question, but she forced herself to answer it
	anyway.  &ldquo;Top drawers,&rdquo; she mumbled between lips that
	still felt a bit numb.  &ldquo;Second cubicle over.&rdquo;  The
	woman hopped up, banged around, was back in seconds.  She set her
	gun down on the floor and opened the kit, began to wipe away the
	blood Bianca had been having trouble reaching.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We need to get you to a
	medic,&rdquo; the woman said kindly.  &ldquo;I'm afraid you're going
	into shock.  I'm Salma.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Bianca.&rdquo;  Then as
	soon as she could shape her lips around the words she wanted: &ldquo;Blunt
	trauma.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes,&rdquo; Salma agreed. 
	&ldquo;You're a doctor?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She nodded.  Salma turned her head
	as someone looked in from outside.  &ldquo;Tell Clay we need a
	transport and a stretcher,&rdquo; she said over her shoulder.  The
	presence at the doorway vanished.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Soon more white-clad people
	appeared, fussed over her, wrapped her in a blanket, loaded her onto
	a stretcher, strapped her in, then lifted it by both ends.  As they
	exited the clinic, Bianca tried to crane her head around to see Tim,
	but she couldn't find him.  Salma, who was walking beside the
	litter, squeezed her hand.  &ldquo;Your friend outside didn't make
	it.  They shot him in the head when we arrived.  I'm sorry.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They were walking toward another
	vehicle, this one obviously a large aircar of some kind.  It was
	unmarked, so it wasn't an ambulance.   Looking from side-to-side,
	Bianca could only see a total of seven people in white.  There were
	a number of lumps in dark uniforms strewn around on the ground near
	her clinic.  None were moving.  As they set her stretcher down on a
	low table inside the car, Salma sat down next to her, still holding
	her hand, and the others, two men, went back out.  Bianca found her
	ability to think returning.  What was it Salma had said they were?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cyberantes?&rdquo; she
	croaked, her throat suddenly dry.  Salma draped a cool, damp cloth
	over her forehead, then got her a cup of water and held it up to her
	lips, tipped her head gently so she could drink it.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That's right.  We're the
	defenders of the cyberverse, against tyranny.  We have rapid
	response teams that can respond to incidents of oppression. 
	Fortunately we were only a few miles away when your alarm came in.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Bianca remembered Tim talking
	about that.  There were special codes and frequencies to call for
	help if you were being victimized.  He'd gotten them an alarm
	subscription and installed the software on their clinic's
	communications console just a few days ago.  That was what he'd
	meant by the distress beacon, she realized now.   Pity it hadn't
	saved him.  Her eyes began to mist over again, this time with tears.
	 She felt really tired, but knew she should try to stay awake.  She
	forced herself to speak again.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You killed all the...
	men...&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">More like animals than men,
	but yes, we took them out.  It was a risk taking on thirty of them
	with eight of us, but we were able to surprise them pretty well. 
	They were KOJ and Homeland Security, a squad of each.  I don't think
	they were expecting opposition,&rdquo; Salma concluded with
	satisfaction in her tone.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A hum of motors and a faint lurch
	of motion attested that they were now airborne.  Flying above Las
	Vegas.  Bianca pictured the Strip as it had been in the old days,
	when the casinos had drawn tourists by the millions.  Almost all of
	those pursuits were in the cyberverse now, out of reach of those who
	had always wanted to shut them down.   These days the Strip was
	mostly dark and silent, though it had been recreated in the heyday
	of its glory countless times in many a simulation.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You beat the odds,&rdquo;
	Bianca commented after a while, and the two women shared a smile.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma was looking out a window as
	they banked.  &ldquo;We'll be there in minutes,&rdquo; she said
	reassuringly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I want to join you,&rdquo;
	Bianca said softly.  Salma turned back to her with a quizzical look.
	 &ldquo;Cyberantes.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma smiled and stroked her
	forehead, a sisterly gesture.  &ldquo;We'd sure be glad to have you.
	 We can always use a doctor, especially one who knows nanomedicine
	and implants.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Bianca nodded, closed her eyes
	against another moment of vertigo as their pilot executed a further
	turn.   She saw Tim's face clearly in her mind's eye.  He was
	smiling.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The stone cavern
	was vast, as big as a stadium.  It was dimly lit in some of its far
	recesses, but brightly illuminated at the front by rows of powerful
	halogen lights on poles.  It was almost packed with Cyberantes, and
	more were still filing in.   There was a vibrant sense of excitement
	and anticipation in the air.  Clay supposed this was partly because
	of the tribe's growing list of successes against authoritarian
	abuses, such as the one they'd scored five days ago in Las Vegas. 
	Now it was time to take the next steps, and everyone could sense it.
	 The group felt its growing muscle.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Of course the excitement could
	also be due to the presence of one particular speaker on tonight's
	agenda.   Since the Cyberantes were supposed to be an underground
	organization, one of Clay's associates with a whimsical sense of
	humor had whipped up this subterranean meeting place.  The
	cyberverse address and access cryptokeys had been distributed to the
	tribe only an hour beforehand.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay saw Salma nearby, chatting
	with a small circle of fellow members, describing what had gone down
	in Vegas.   As he'd rather expected, her physical person was
	considerably less attractive than her cyberverse avatar, not to
	mention a bit older than he'd imagined.  Nevertheless the qualities
	she exhibited in real space, her courage, integrity, compassion, and
	level-headed determination, were the same ones that he valued most
	when it came right down to it &ndash; in any reality.  He was glad
	that they'd had the opportunity to meet and work together in
	meatspace, because he'd discovered that he loved her even more
	deeply, regardless of the face that she wore.  He hoped she felt the
	same way about him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He couldn't see Cylara or Torch,
	though he supposed they were in the crowd somewhere.  Earlier he'd
	greeted that lady doctor, Bianca, whom they'd rescued in Vegas. 
	This was her first big meeting.  It must be a lot of people's first
	meeting, judging from the attendance level.  Clay guessed that well
	over eighty thousand avatars filled the cavern now.  Impressive
	turnout.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He'd always believed that a
	schedule was a contract, so he'd written that into the bylaws.  His
	heads-up chronometer was flashing that it was time to start the
	meeting, so he moved toward the front where instead of a podium
	there was a kind of acoustical horn built right into the wall of the
	cavern.  At his signal, the rows of lights in front dimmed and
	brightened a couple of times.  The vast hubbub of countless
	conversations began to subside, as the attendees all turned to face
	the front.  There was nowhere to sit, for anybody, and this was by
	design to help keep the meeting short.  Clay stepped into the horn
	and raised his arms for silence.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Fortunately he'd lost his fear of
	public speaking quite early in his career.  Still, he couldn't help
	but feel some pressure to make sure he said the Right Thing, and not
	any number of Wrong Things that lurked among his possible options
	for choice of words.  Respectful, interested silence quickly
	descended and he lowered his arms.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Thank you all for turning
	up.  For those of you who are new, welcome to the Irregular Army for
	the Defense of the Cyberverse, also known as the Cyberantes.   I'm
	Clay Thorsten, and I'm a founding member of this very special mesh
	tribe.   I'm not its leader.  We don't have leaders by virtue of
	right or authority.   Our leaders in any capacity or situation are
	those who volunteer to serve, and can get others to volunteer to
	follow them.  So if you're looking for the <I>Regular</I> Army of
	anything, you're in the wrong place.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Some good-natured laughter and
	amused clapping greeted these remarks.  &ldquo;We now have Tyranny
	Response Teams, or TRTs, in place in every major population center
	within the Federation,&rdquo; Clay continued.  &ldquo;Our incident
	command system has been dispatching those teams as required whenever
	subscribers call for assistance.  As you all know, we've experienced
	an early series of signal successes.  We hope soon to be in a
	position to thwart any raid, anywhere, anytime, made by political or
	religious aggressors, within a matter of minutes.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This produced a groundswell of
	applause and cheers.   &ldquo;Each of our members is encouraged to
	volunteer for TRT duty, as many hours per week as you are willing to
	donate.  Those who still require bio-upgrades, combat training, or
	equipment before they can receive their readiness certification
	should apply with one of the IADC Paias for information and
	assistance.  Those who are staffing our support, supply,
	communications, intelligence, R&amp;D, and fundraising positions,
	thank you.  Your help is needed and welcomed every bit as much as
	TRT volunteers.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Boilerplate finished, Clay moved
	on quickly to the meat of what the meeting was about.  &ldquo;Our
	intel reports reveal that Federation anti-cyberverse forces, stung
	by the successes of our TRTs, are planning a major escalation.  As
	nearly as we can determine, they intend to precipitate a situation
	which will provoke a TRT deployment.  Then they'll throw military
	hardware and personnel into the fray to overwhelm our TRT, along
	with any backup that it might summon.  They reason that doing this
	will break the back of our willingness to field teams in response to
	their acts of aggression.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He paused for effect, and to wait
	for the smattering of boos to die down.  &ldquo;What they don't
	realize is that we now have sufficient numbers, together with
	superior technology and equipment, to meet their military force head
	on, and smash it.  We are, therefore, going to allow this scenario
	to unfold so that we can break the back of <I>their</I> willingness
	to interfere with the operation of the cyberverse, or with the
	rights and freedoms of those who wish to inhabit it!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There came a furious, fist-waving,
	arm-pumping, foot-stomping cheer which rocked the cavern at this
	announcement.  Most of the members had known about these
	developments beforehand, but Clay would never underestimate the
	effect of stating them publicly so that the emotion of the moment
	could be felt and shared.  If he'd had any need to feel personal
	power and adulation, the response he was getting would have gone a
	long way toward assuaging that hunger.  But fortunately he did not. 
	He merely wanted the bad guys stopped cold, so that he could go back
	to his regularly scheduled life.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">When quiet returned again, it
	remained only to introduce the night's special speaker.  &ldquo;On
	the eve of these stirring events, we have a special guest speaker
	tonight.  Please join me in welcoming the genius whose project
	inadvertently precipitated this entire conflict, and the best boss
	I've ever had, Dr. Stefan Jager of the Archimedes Institute!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Warm applause and whistles greeted
	Stefan as he climbed up next to Clay and shook his hand, before Clay
	stepped down and vanished into the front of the crowd.   Stefan was
	dressed respectably but casually, his dark hair and beard neatly
	combed, his scientist's physique readily apparent in a crowd filled
	mostly with exemplars of fitness.  His deep voice growled out of the
	acoustical horn, carrying to the back of the cavern as easily as
	Clay's had, despite its softer tone.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Thank you for having me. 
	It's amazing and gratifying what you have all accomplished so
	quickly.   The Cyberantes are a testament to what can be achieved
	when will and principle are united.  Your willingness to put your
	very lives on the line to defend Liberty and the Singularity are an
	inspiration to all humankind.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Since you are doing so much
	for us, for your fellow sapient intelligences, biological and non,
	we consider that it's only right that we do the best we can for you.
	 We've also made fantastic progress, in the development of what has
	been dubbed the Last Trumpet Project.   And so I'm here tonight to
	give you my solemn pledge, that anyone who falls in battle against
	the forces of oppression will go right to the front of the scanning
	queue.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This time the response began
	slowly, then abruptly swelled to thunderous applause.  Friends and
	comrades exchanged looks, realizing that the greatest fear of
	soldiers and crusaders throughout time, that they might have to die
	for their cause, had just been removed.  There would be no death,
	and it was for this that they would fight.  The symmetry which
	Stefan invoked was lost on no one.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He waited patiently, smiling,
	until their response died away.  &ldquo;You need not fear.  With
	your help, because of the things you are doing, knowledge will
	prevail over ignorance.  Science will prevail over superstition.  
	And that which makes us all human, will be exalted into a world
	without end.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">One word more.  As you
	struggle, I would ask you to remember that mercy and compassion are
	among the highest human virtues.  They do not, of course, require
	that we perpetually insulate others from the consequences of their
	own individual choices.  But please be mindful of the boundaries of
	necessity, and do not destroy without need.  My deepest respect and
	sincere best wishes to all of you.&rdquo;  With a friendly wave, to
	more applause, Stefan walked out of the horn's embrasure, returning
	to the companions he'd come in with.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay got up to thank his employer
	for addressing them, and then entertained a motion to adjourn, which
	was forthcoming.  The IADC prided itself on the brevity of its
	meetings.  So much could be handled through the mesh, via Paias and
	other communications and detail management AIs, that there was
	little excuse to keep people hanging around listening to a litany of
	reports, requests, needs and attaboys that they could easily access
	and sort through for themselves.  Meetings ought to serve mainly
	social and inspirational functions.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So many people wanted to greet
	Stefan, or ask him something, that Clay found it impossible to
	approach him.  Which didn't matter a bit, since he'd see him
	tomorrow morning at their staff meeting in any event.   A man with
	Stefan, whom Clay didn't know, a slender dude with sandy short hair
	and pale eyes, met Clay's look and gave him a friendly smile and an
	appreciative nod.  Something in the way he did that said clearly:
	&ldquo;We'll talk later.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">For now, Clay found Salma suddenly
	at his elbow.  She put a warm hand around his waist and kissed his
	cheek.  &ldquo;Good meeting tonight,&rdquo; she said.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Short,&rdquo; he agreed. 
	&ldquo;With a couple of surprises.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Best kind.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The waterfall
	made the hot day seem cooler and more pleasant.  It was
	mid-afternoon, and Justin and Petrov sat opposite one another at a
	table placed near the foot of the falls.  Faint tendrils of mist
	drifted over from the spray to condense on the umbrella covering
	their table.  Tall, cool drinks stood between them.  Justin was
	dressed as if for a leisurely safari, while Petrov was garbed in
	colorful loose robes and a tall skull cap that recalled his East

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Said Petrov: &ldquo;I'm concerned

	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As am I.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What Stefan has effectively

	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not necessarily.  No such

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov sighed.  &ldquo;None of

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin shrugged.  &ldquo;I agree,
	but what would you have had Stefan do?  Decline to offer the

	destroyed fighting on the right side?  That's how he sees it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">If we're the right side,

	Violence is not an intelligent solution.  So long as it's employed
	defensively it may be morally justifiable, but it's still not

	state.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You know, I had the
	distinct impression last time we got together, that you had some
	idea in that regard.&rdquo;  Justin smiled, knowing full well that
	this must be why his friend had invited him here.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I did,&rdquo; Petrov
	replied after a moment and a taste of his cocktail.  &ldquo;Something
	Shanti said, that it would be good if they fought us on our own
	ground in the cyberverse.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I remember.  But how is
	that possible?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It's possible if they
	perceive a vital objective which can be achieved only in
	virtuality.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin pondered this for a
	heartbeat.  &ldquo;Such as?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A key that will give them
	undisputed, convincing victory.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There is none, Petrov.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov grinned.  &ldquo;Of course
	there isn't.   But it's only necessary that the Moshes <I>believe</I>
	in one. </FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Consider
	what we know about their mindset.   The political class, like
	Sarner, believe in the innate superiority of centralized, planned
	solutions to problems, implemented through the exercise of
	authority.  The religious adherents, like Cleary, believe in the
	inevitability of victory through the exercise of divine will.  They
	expect that a means to victory <I>must</I> exist, and that it shall
	come to pass, as they say, that God will in due course reveal it to
	them.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">All right, stipulated.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So what if there was some
	piece of information, which could only be found in the cyberverse,
	that would enable them to uncreate it once they gained access to
	it?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That of course is absurd,
	but did you have something in mind?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes.  What if there were a
	master list of all the nodes in the cyberverse, an address book for
	the entire system, which would tell them the GPS coordinates where
	every simulation was hosted, where everybody like us lives, and the
	list of storage devices where any given data file is stored?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin was floored by this
	suggestion.  He paused for a gulp of his drink before replying, as
	if he needed to recover from the shock before he could speak.  &ldquo;But
	Petrov, they're not complete fools.  They know all about DR.OS. 
	Hell, the complete operating protocols are published openly all over
	the place.   It's no secret how the system works.  It's open source,
	for crying out loud!  Even a Mosh programmer ought to be able to
	look at the facts and deduce that what you've just described is the
	polar opposite of how the system is actually implemented.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov laughed cheerfully.  &ldquo;Of
	course!  But what we need to concern ourselves with is how these
	<I>particular</I> Moshes, especially their decision-makers, will
	receive this information.   I believe I've worked that out.  Just as
	I knew that you, Justin, would find the notion utterly unbelievable.
	 You're too intelligent, and too driven by the recognition of facts.
	 You don't let what you want to believe override the things that you
	know to be true.  But in this case I fear you're letting your own
	rationality seduce you into underestimating the self-deceptive
	capacity of our opponents.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In that case,&rdquo; Justin
	said with a slight suggestion of a seated bow, &ldquo;I had better
	listen attentively while you explain why our opponents will find
	themselves compelled to believe such a fantastic story.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov smiled.  &ldquo;We've
	already seen some evidence,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that the Moshes
	don't really grok the mesh: specifically, their surprise at how
	little permanent damage their Operation Skull Fracture did to
	virtuality.  You said it yourself at our last meeting.  They're
	ignorant of both the principles of self-extending geodesic computer
	networks, and of free market economics.  Anyone who did understand
	those principles, who truly grasped the nature and genius of DR.OS,
	wouldn't have expected to deal a knockout blow.  I suspect that a
	similar unpleasant surprise awaits them whenever their first
	significant battle versus the Cyberantes takes place.  It would
	never occur to them that an upstart mesh tribe, organizing
	spontaneously in response to their own authoritarian abuses, could
	so rapidly accumulate the wealth, technology, skills, numbers, and
	leadership required in order to kick the collective ass of their
	antique, rigidly centralized military.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It certainly occurred to
	me.  In fact I expected it, and I said as much.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That you did.  But that's
	because you have something which an authoritarian lacks.  Namely, a
	faith in spontaneous order.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin nodded slowly.  &ldquo;They
	like to think that the only way things can work is if they're
	centrally planned and controlled.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Exactly.  Which is
	precisely why they'll believe in the existence of a Master Node
	List.  From their point of view, it's the only way something as vast
	as the cyberverse could possibly work.  The fact that the published
	protocols don't speak of any such thing is because it was necessary
	to conceal the truth, so that no one would ever try to seize the
	List.  And because you, Justin, are a hypocrite.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Actually, of course, I
	aspire to rule the world,&rdquo; Justin said smiling.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Aha.  No doubt.   And as
	for the religious Moshes, they'll quickly decide that this secret
	vulnerability &ndash; once it gets revealed to them in a way that
	suggests divine intervention &ndash; constitutes their expected
	hidden pathway to the inevitable victory of the righteous.  Which
	will look like a doubly attractive avenue to follow after they've
	suffered a few more inglorious defeats in meatspace.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So I presume you also have
	in mind some means of simulating this divine revelation?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well I suppose that burning
	bushes talking, or handwriting manifesting spontaneously on walls,
	is probably out.  An obvious miracle would be immediately suspect. 
	But I was thinking that we might pass the misinformation through
	Daniel Cleary, the Reverend's son.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin raised an eyebrow.  &ldquo;Didn't
	know he had a son.  Is he given to having visions?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not exactly.  But he has
	been functioning as the KOJ's principal spy planted inside the
	cyberverse.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You're kidding me.  A KOJ,
	living in virtuality?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Special dispensations. 
	Only his family knows he's been leading a double life.  Even Sarner
	doesn't yet know who the inside man is.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You speak with certainty.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov shrugged.  &ldquo;Some of
	my newer creations have the capability of detecting bugged avatars. 
	Young Cleary came to visit several of my latest virtualities wearing
	a trace that connected back to Ferret.  I considered this unusual
	enough that I tracked him back to his jack to find out who and where
	he was.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clever.  And quite
	conclusive, I must admit.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">After that, it occurred to
	me that building him up as a trusted source who obtained useful
	information might pay dividends down the line.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Of course.  What
	information did you give him?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well, I arranged for one of
	my systems installers to hand him a cryptokey with the Singularity
	crest on it.  He also intimated that it led to a habitation being
	prepared for the resurrected dead.  In reality it went to a late
	1980s New York City simulation which was put up for a nostalgia
	tour, and had recently been decommissioned. But I reprogrammed the
	supervisor AI to offer Cleary and his friends some very significant
	jargon suggesting that we &ndash; or someone &ndash; was able to
	track everything that went on in the whole cyberverse.   A spew of
	implausible nonsense, but which implied the existence of an
	omniscient mesh superpower somewhere.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You fox.  You've been
	planning something like this for months.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Since you asked me to
	provide housing for the Project's clients, in fact.  It occurred to
	me that the hosting for such virtualities might be subjected to
	attack.  At any rate, the others (Daniel's Sing friends) naturally
	discounted it all, and I'm not even sure that Daniel bought it,
	entirely &ndash; he's beginning to think independently of his
	upbringing, given constant exposure to other modes of thought.  But
	the important point is that he reported this strange experience to
	his father.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Right,&rdquo; agreed
	Justin.  &ldquo;Hence the elder Cleary will now be predisposed to
	believe anything which appears to make sense of that which made no
	sense before.  So who are these friends that young Daniel hangs out
	with?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Ordinary bio Sings. 
	Chiefly his girlfriend, and Clay Thorsten, and Clay's girlfriend. 
	The two couples seem to double-date a lot.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin's jaw dropped.  &ldquo;The
	Clay Thorsten who's been organizing the Cyberantes?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The same.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Oh, boy.   I just saw
	Thorsten last night, at Stefan's appearance, though we didn't get a
	chance to speak.  That means Daniel has access to&ndash;&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">To all kinds of useful
	information, yes.  Where necessary, I've taken care to make certain
	Daniel doesn't gain access to anything too critical.  It's been much
	easier to do that since the demise of Ferret, since they can't
	really trace his movements anymore.  For example, I made sure to
	have Stefan set up the meeting of Daniel Cleary and his friends with
	Arturo Scalleni in a special virtuality used solely for that
	purpose.  By coincidence, Scalleni is the first cousin of Clay's
	girlfriend Salma, so that meeting was certain to occur.  I took some
	old hardware that the company was decommissioning, and thew it out
	into a brand new site in the middle of Labrador.  I guessed that
	Daniel's tap would lead Ferret right to it, and sure enough they
	blew it up on 3/3.  Doubtless thinking it was a state-of-the-art
	hosting for Last Trumpet people such as Art.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin shook his head, now
	chuckling with admiration.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It gets better,&rdquo;
	Petrov went on, grinning.  &ldquo;At that meeting, Art mentioned
	that he'd been a murder victim, and that we knew about it by the
	expedient of turning the Cronus Scanner on the dam.  Young Daniel
	goes screaming back to his daddy with this news, daddy tells Sarner,
	and next thing you know Operation Skull Fracture comes together
	almost overnight.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So after these bits of
	choice intel which have proven reliable, anything we leak through
	Daniel is bound to be treated as pure gold.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Precisely.&rdquo;    Petrov
	reached down to scratch his pet's ears.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin thought for a minute,
	considering the angles as he slowly took another drink.  &ldquo;Do
	Daniel's friends know who or what he really is?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov shook his head.  &ldquo;No,
	they know him only as Torch.  Though I think his girlfriend, Cylara
	Janovic, may be beginning to form some suspicions.   On the other
	hand, the two appear to be falling very much in love.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel is in love with a
	Sing woman?&rdquo;  Justin looked a tad incredulous.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Apparently so.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">How perfectly scandalous. 
	Is there any chance that relationship could induce him to abandon
	his father, I wonder?&rdquo; Justin pondered.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Possible I suppose, given
	the right circumstances.  We can predict with some certainty the way
	the mind will react.  But even we can't predict the choices of the
	heart.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin grunted agreement, still
	engrossed in thought.  &ldquo;The quest for this mythical Master
	Node List will not only lead some of our opponents to venture into
	the cyberverse seeking it, it will also cause them to cease their
	efforts to destroy random servers,&rdquo; he said steadily.  &ldquo;They
	won't want to risk inadvertently destroying the one that contains
	the List.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov nodded.  &ldquo;Or the ones
	presently hosting their avatars while they search for it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Which means that we'll get
	the cease fire we wanted, along with a reduction in confrontational
	violence.  The Cyberantes will only react to the illicit use of
	force; they won't initiate any themselves.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Of course.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And that buys time for
	Riksana and I, and the rest of our team to finish our work.  A
	couple months is all we need, perhaps less.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Indeed.  Delaying the
	radical Moshes plays into our hands.  Not to mention the fact that
	the longer their rank and file spend in the cyberverse seeing what
	it has to offer and how people actually live there, the less
	committed they are likely to be to destroying it.  Do you perceive
	any chance for a political solution, Justin?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Funny you should ask that. 
	Perhaps there is.  Recently I've had some peculiar contacts with
	Robert Reynolds, a Federation senator.   Eleven days ago my Paia
	gave me a pair of messages from the man.  She told me one had been
	cleverly embedded within the other using steganography.  The outer
	message requested a meeting with me to discuss negotiating some kind
	of settlement with the government.  The inner warned me that it was
	a trap, that all the elected officials were being held hostage by
	Sarner, and that all their communications were bugged and their
	encryption keys compromised.  Which only confirms what we'd
	privately supposed.  Reynolds wants to be rescued, and offers to
	denounce Sarner publicly in return.  I've opened a cautious dialog
	with him concerning the prospects.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was Petrov's turn to consider. 
	&ldquo;If you were to keep your appointment for a meeting, it would
	represent irresistible bait.  You, after all, are the person most
	likely to be in possession of the Master Node List, or at least to
	know where it's kept.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">True.  So now all I need to
	figure out is how to spring Reynolds, and then get Sarner to start
	chasing me.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Oh, that shouldn't be hard
	for somebody of your talents, my friend.&rdquo;  Petrov's leopard
	was getting to her feet and stretching, and he crooned something at
	her and patted her head.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Hard, no.  But it's damned
	inconvenient.  I have better things to do, as Riksana is constantly
	reminding me.  I'm sure she won't be too happy about my continued
	indispensability to the cause of Mosh relations.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov laughed.  &ldquo;Riksana's
	intensity is a goad to us all, sometimes.  But it's only for a
	little while.  Then this mortal coil, as they say, will truly fall
	off, and fascinating times will indeed be upon us.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I know.  It's the last leg
	of the race.  And if I have to carry the baton one last time around
	the track, well so be it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That's the spirit.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov, I want you to know
	how much your friendship and counsel mean to me.  As always, you've
	been a huge help.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov stood up to his full
	height, and bowed his head in polite acknowledgment.  Justin rose
	too, and leaned across the table to shake his hand.  The big cat
	suddenly froze, focused intently on something in the brush nearby at
	the base of the falls.  Abruptly it sped away in a silent rush,
	disappearing at once into the foliage.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Decisive, isn't she?&rdquo;
	Justin remarked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Her programming is too
	simple to be paralyzed by analysis,&rdquo; Petrov explained dryly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Ha.  See you again soon.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Good luck.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin zoned out via a portal
	which appeared around him and quickly shrank into the distance. 
	From Justin's perspective, Petrov, still standing by the table at
	the foot of the falls looking into the brush after his cat as if
	already lost in thought, dwindled to a faint brush stroke of bright
	pixels before spinning off into the grey gyre between worlds.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The Battle of Phoenix</FONT></FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The heat of
	midday beat down on pastel-colored houses, white and stucco roofs,
	rock gardens and citrus trees, and shimmered over the dark,
	crumbling pavement.  Just a quiet neighborhood in the greater
	Phoenix area, lined with houses dating back at least fifty years.  
	Many looked unoccupied now, but some were still maintained and
	obviously inhabited.  The decaying streets curved around a golf
	course, much more challenging to play now than it had once been,
	owing to increasingly spotty maintenance.   A few of the occupied
	houses still had swimming pools that were filled.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma stood in the open doorway of
	one such house, waiting for its occupants to emerge with some of
	their belongings.  The rest of her team was spread out around the
	house, or across the street at another occupied home, alertly
	keeping watch.   Up the block, a government aircar bearing NAF
	insignias burned merrily, belching a plume of oily black smoke.  The
	street around it was littered with black-uniformed bodies.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma glanced nervously at the
	chronometer ticking in her heads-up display.  Nearly ten minutes
	since they'd made the hit.  The enemy forces should be converging on
	their position shortly.  The family they were evacuating, a man and
	a woman and three teenage children, emerged from the back bedrooms
	carrying bulging duffels.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Good, get in the airbus
	quickly, please,&rdquo; she urged them, and stepped out of their
	way.  The vehicle in question was parked in front of their
	neighbor's house.  It was a large transport which could carry about
	sixty people and their luggage.  Another house or two and it would
	be at capacity, and would take off for base.  The voluntary
	evacuation was going smoothly, but there was no way they were going
	to get everyone out of the forthcoming battle zone before the shit
	storm started.  They were playing a dangerous game.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">For what it was worth, Salma
	locked up the front door.  A klaxon sounded in her head and a
	tactical report streamed across her field of vision.  Enemy troop
	transports and air cover, incoming to their position.  Soundlessly,
	Salma flashed instructions at her team over their chat channel,
	which they all heard as her voice speaking in their heads.  &ldquo;Take
	cover, and get the bus out of here now!  We'll defend from these
	four houses, two on each side of the street.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As soon as the last family made it
	inside the bus, it lifted off and streaked away, making good speed
	but holding a low altitude.  Its departure was certain to be
	observed, though.  Salma's TRT activated their stealth mode,
	blending invisibly into the walls of the houses behind their backs,
	facing up the street toward the burning vehicle.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A roar of what sounded like
	fighter planes came out of the north and flashed by overhead,
	followed by a handful of what looked like &ndash; no, what <I>were </I>&ndash;
	attack helicopters.   Behind them were three bulky black transports,
	about the same size as the airbus that had just departed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They've got to be kidding,&rdquo;
	the voice of Salma's lieutenant said in her mind.  The transports
	landed one by one, flanking the burning vehicle and its late crew. 
	Troopers boiled out of them, clad in black body armor, carrying
	high-powered automatic rifles.  The helicopters hovered protectively
	overhead, rotating slowly as their gunners scanned for targets.  The
	Cyberantes' bodysuit armor now blocked infrared signals, so they
	wouldn't spot any of them standing against the buildings.  This was
	just too good a chance to miss.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma gave the next order:
	&ldquo;Anti-rotor sawbots, two per 'copter.  Your nearest targets,
	now.&rdquo;  There were five enemy choppers, so ten of her commandos
	unclipped a grenade-like object from their utility belts and
	activated them.   After a moment to align their self-guiding sensors
	to the target, they were all tossed into the air.  The tiny robots
	sprouted thin, silvery chains that spun rapidly around an axis. 
	These were made of jagged nanosteel filaments, resembling the band
	of a chainsaw.  The bots launched themselves at the choppers, moving
	like darting sparrows.  A high-pitched whine cycled upward past the
	range of human hearing as the rotation speed of their filament
	chains reached maximum.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The sawbots' AIs guided them
	unerringly right to the center of the rotor housing, where the
	spinning filaments sheared off the main steel rotor blades like a
	buzz saw cutting through a bundle of twigs.  In seconds all five
	helicopters were plummeting earthward, yawing and spinning with
	engines screaming as they augered in.  One of them crashed in the
	front yard of the house where Salma and several companions were
	standing.  They ducked and turned their faces away from the
	explosion, feeling the compression wave's heat push them toward the
	building, and bits of shrapnel bouncing harmlessly off their suits. 
	 Fortunately the severed rotors had arced over the house to land a
	block or two away.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Anybody hurt?&rdquo; Salma
	asked.  No one replied.  The three transports had disgorged their
	full troop compliment by now, who had mostly hit the deck when it
	started raining choppers.  As Salma had hoped, two of those had
	landed amid the enemy force, though with what extent of casualties
	was difficult to determine through all the smoke and flame.  Well,
	no reason to give them any time to catch their balance.  &ldquo;Detonating
	charges,&rdquo; she advised.  &ldquo;In 3-2-1-0.&rdquo;  She plucked
	a pager-sized device off her belt, flicked off a safety, and pressed
	the firing stud.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Immediately the small but powerful
	explosive mines which they'd seeded in the burning NAF transport,
	and strewn around it amid the debris in a twenty yard radius,
	exploded simultaneously.    Armored bodies, and parts of armored
	bodies, blew everywhere.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Move up and hose them down
	briefly,&rdquo; Salma commanded.  Her force of twenty sprinted
	toward the reeling enemy troops, who were still hugging the ground
	looking for cover that wasn't there.  At a range inside one hundred
	feet, where their best new armor-piercing rounds had at least some
	chance of penetrating enemy body armor, they broke stealth and swept
	the enemy with a sustained burst of automatic gunfire.   Some
	troopers were obviously hit, but it was hard to tell which ones
	because they were all lying flat and still.  But when a few prone
	soldiers began to fire back Salma called a cease fire.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Break off, retreat south,
	reassert stealth.  I'm sure they have reinforcements on the way.&rdquo;
	 As they jogged off down the street away from the massacre, those
	who had deployed sawbots hit their recall switches.  The bots, which
	had remained airborne after crashing their targets, deactivated
	their deadly spinning nanosteel filaments and flew back to their
	owners, who folded them up and replaced them on their belts as they
	ran.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Their team's mission was
	proceeding nicely.  They were to harass and humiliate the enemy,
	using hit and run guerrilla tactics, forcing the enemy to escalate
	and pursue them.  They would then suck them into a trap where a much
	larger Cyberantes force would be waiting.  The trick was to move
	nimbly enough to avoid being hunted down and killed before they
	reached their compatriots' ambush.  They were going to have to be
	more careful from now on just where they crashed enemy aircraft: the
	neighborhood they were now entering had not yet been evacuated. 
	Salma checked the time again.   Probably about half an hour till the
	real show time.  Maintaining a V formation, they jogged tirelessly
	down the street and faded from view again.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay studied his
	tactical map intently.   He was standing in a small vehicle which
	floated a few feet off the ground, resembling a cross between a
	hover scooter and a flying pedestal.  It had hand grips like a
	motorcycle, replete with numerous controls, and the large instrument
	panel behind the windscreen was mainly given over to a wide oval
	tactical display, which showed position and transponder signals
	collected from the whole of the Phoenix theater, both on the ground
	and in the air.  For representing this amount of information, an
	external screen worked much better than his in-vision heads-up
	display, and allowed him to reserve the latter for urgent alerts.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Assembled around him were about
	three thousand Cyberantes infantry, roughly a third of them mounted,
	as he was, on flying bikes of various kinds.  They had taken their
	position in an open space on a former fairway of the Papago Park
	golf course, not far from what had once been the Phoenix zoo.  A
	detachment of drones clustered in a grove of sickly palm trees
	nearby.   Unmanned platforms hovered protectively overhead about a
	thousand feet up, floated aloft by linked strings of evacuated
	spheres.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The enemy forces were already
	pushing through downtown Phoenix in their direction.  Running
	skirmishes were in progress in at least four places on the arc along
	the front, Cyberantes teams maintaining contact only enough to draw
	the enemy onward.  A slight distortion rippled over his map,
	blurring some of the data there.  Enemy signal jamming, evidently.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Shift to ground bass
	carrier communications,&rdquo; he ordered, speaking the words aloud
	but only for convenience, since thinking them with the intent to
	broadcast was sufficient to distribute them to the message routing
	AI.  By popular acclamation of the tribal officers present, and
	somewhat to his surprise, Clay had been given theater command today.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Moments later a bass rumble, like
	a drumbeat conducted through the very earth beneath them, vibrated
	on the extreme low edge of human hearing.  Those standing on the
	ground felt it tremble through their feet.  About every three
	seconds it was repeated, a steady thrumming pulse like an immense
	slow, subterranean heartbeat.   Within a pulse or two Clay's display
	had cleared up.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In response to his instruction,
	every signaling and scanning device on their side had now switched
	over to a protocol which utilized the sonic waves being propagated
	through the ground as a carrier wave.   The data was encoded in the
	noise attached to the main signal, but could not be jammed unless
	the enemy could silence the carrier transmission itself &ndash; a
	stone impossibility.  The only downside was that updates now arrived
	in bursts every three seconds, though this deficiency was
	compensated for by automatic signal buffering.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay considered activating some
	signal jamming capabilities of their own, but decided it was too
	soon.  No point in making it too difficult for the NAF forces to
	keep together and stay pointed in the right direction.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A group of bogeys sped toward
	Clay's position on his monitor, a few thousand feet up, sweeping out
	of the southwest over the old airport.  High speed attack aircraft
	of some kind, ten of them.  As they passed overhead they dropped
	ordinance on the assembled troops.   The robotic platforms above
	came to life, generating intense microbursts of heated air which
	deflected the projectiles aside so that they hit the ground hundreds
	of yards off target.  A number of nearby houses were abruptly turned
	into infernos.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay signaled for a launch of
	anti-aircraft drones.   Out from among the palm trees a small flock
	of glittering shapes rose like steel dragonflies and flitted off
	after the circling planes, accelerating so fast that they flew like
	angry thoughts.   In seconds they were out of sight, but the next
	compression pulse through the ground showed them on his screen,
	rapidly closing on the enemy planes.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This particular type of drone did
	not carry missiles.  Rather, it was an enlargement on the sawbot
	concept.  Vastly faster and more maneuverable than any military
	aircraft ever built &ndash; they'd been clocked at more than Mach 15
	at sea level &ndash; these dragonfly drones need only stroll up
	behind their targets, which were flying at subsonic speeds, and loop
	a nanosteel cutting whip around the empennage of each plane. 
	Seconds later it would be without rear stabilizers or control
	surfaces, irrevocably out of control.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sure enough, all ten of the
	attacking aircraft never completed a second pass, instead augering
	into the ground some miles away from any friendly forces (the
	dragonflies being smart enough to take targets' trajectory into
	account when they crashed them).  The drones flitted around the
	battlefield looking for more unfriendly aircraft, following a
	seek-and-destroy program.  Anything hostile which flew into the
	theater wasn't likely to stay airborne long, absent new orders to
	the contrary.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sensors detected a large quantity
	of exchanged gunfire, which was highlighted on Clay's tactical map. 
	One of their squads had let the advancing enemy overhaul them a bit
	too closely, forcing them to turn and fight against superior
	numbers.  Fortunately, this eventuality had been anticipated.  There
	were two much larger Cyberantes units nearby on hover bikes, less
	than two minutes away.  Although it might be tipping off their
	strategy a bit soon, he could not fail to extricate that squad that

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The rebels
	continued to flee into the suburbs, sliding out east toward
	Scottsdale.  They'd tried to hold the downtown area, but had fled
	like exposed roaches once the main body of Federation troops
	arrived.  Obviously the anarchists had completely underestimated the
	willingness of the Federation to commit whatever forces it took to
	kick their asses.   Roger Sarner was still steaming over the
	casualties from their cowardly ambushes, especially that one
	involving the helicopters.  Well, their hit and run tactics were
	over.  It was run all the way now, run or die.  Goddamned Sing
	insurgents.  This escalation was all their fault, really.  They
	wouldn't let law enforcement do their jobs, but kept interfering
	with their cowardly attacks, and now they had pretty much the whole
	Federation army after their scruffy butts.  Served them right.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner was riding, as a passenger,
	inside an elite armored command vehicle.    This baby was built in
	the 2020s, not quite twenty years ago, back when they were still
	coming out with good next generation military stuff, before the tax
	base had withered completely and put a stop to development.   It had
	impervious nanosteel armor, a main gun with a fifty mile range and
	seven firing modes, half a dozen anti-personnel Gatling guns fore
	and aft, and enough battlefield communications and data analysis
	capability to keep up with the demands of managing an entire
	continent-wide theater of operations.  This tank, and the handful of
	others like it, also boasted a magnificent electronic warfare suite,
	which was even now being employed to keep those Sing bastards from
	talking to each other.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It used to disturb Sarner that the
	newest combat gear they had was about twenty years old, and most of
	it a good deal older than that.  But the fact was that in the years
	since military production had ceased, nobody had bothered to build
	anything better.  Seems the cyber-anarchist types had no stomach for
	war in the real world, which was, as various commentators had
	pointed out, a very messy business.   The result was that the
	military legacy which the North American Federation had inherited
	from the former United States empire, though aging, was still the
	best in the world.   Their only problem was keeping enough of it
	running, and enough people trained on the hardware, to maintain an
	effective force in the field.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Federation forces in Phoenix
	numbered over twenty thousand men, mostly kitted out as mobile
	infantry, in armored survival suits linked into the comm grid. 
	There were also hundreds of support vehicles, including a few dozen
	tanks and armored personnel carriers.  Their fighter cover was
	limited, only about two dozen planes, which was all they could
	scrape up in a serviceable condition on short notice.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But there were lots more in
	mothballs in various places, both armor and aircraft.  All they
	lacked was the money it would take to restore them and train up
	crews.   The KOJ boys were working out just great as volunteer
	soldiers.  They could learn anything, and boy were they motivated. 
	Old Cleary might be a prick but he sure knew how to get guys fired
	up.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The money angle was the bigger
	problem.  Sarner had already hit up the central bank for a massive
	bond purchase, right after he'd given orders appropriating pretty
	much the entire Federation budget for the crusade against the
	cyberverse and its resident terrorists, so that they'd have some
	repayment ability.  Sure, some people were whining about how the
	Life Necessities projects were foundering, but Sarner would be
	damned before he'd authorize expenditures to feed and house idiots
	who spent their time jacked into the cyberverse.  Those people were
	the enemy, for God's sake!  Why subsidize the problem on the
	government's nickel?  That was the kind of thinking that got the
	Federation into this mess to start with.  Unfortunately, the
	collection of back taxes which had gone hand-in-glove with their
	cyberverse equipment raids, wasn't producing enough revenue to
	sustain a military budget.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner shook his head, thinking of
	the President, with whom he'd had an angry confrontation via video a
	few days ago.  She'd accused him of subverting democracy and
	basically everything the Federation stood for.  He checked his
	watch.   It showed him that in less than forty-five minutes, the
	President would most likely be dead.  A hit squad &ndash; carefully
	disguised as one of those white-clad ninja vigilante groups &ndash;
	was even now on its way to Albuquerque to get him the last word in
	their argument.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He was seated at a round table
	which functioned as a data console, alongside three other men: the
	tank crew captain, the theater commander (one General Nelsen), and
	one of Nelsen's aides, who mostly relayed orders.  As the four
	watched the dots move around on the tactical map embedded in the
	tabletop, Sarner reflected that after they crushed these insurgents
	today, they really ought to give some thought to reasserting the
	integrity of the Federation's borders.  This many men were going to
	need something to do after this was finished.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The general's aide, an earnest
	young man with a somewhat nervous manner, suddenly looked concerned
	at what he was hearing in his earpiece.   Sarner didn't bother to
	ask what was the matter, there being no doubt whatsoever that the
	boy was going to tell them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We've just lost about half
	our air cover, sir,&rdquo; he said in an apologetic tone.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">How the hell'd they manage
	that?&rdquo; Sarner asked immediately, before the general could even
	open his mouth.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Apparently some kind of
	anti-aircraft drones, sir.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Where'd they launch those
	from?&rdquo; General Nelsen wanted to know, this time beating Sarner
	to the punch.  Bright guy, this Nelsen.  Ruthless, too.  Which of
	course was why Sarner had promoted him from eastern Homeland
	Security bureau chief to General of the New Federation Army.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">About here, sir,&rdquo; the
	aide said, pointing to a spot some miles away, on a golf course. 
	&ldquo;It looks like there's a larger mass of enemy troops there as
	well.  Their main force it would seem.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">How many?&rdquo; Nelsen
	queried.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Several thousand, according
	to the reports based on the aerial images.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Thousands?&rdquo; Sarner
	exclaimed in an offended tone.  &ldquo;They're not supposed to have
	that many vigilantes, or any defensive drones, either.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Could they be getting
	supplied by another government?&rdquo; Nelsen wondered.  He and
	Sarner exchanged glances.  If true, that could explain a lot. 
	&ldquo;Nevertheless, it's a wonderful opportunity to crush what must
	be a significant percentage of their forces,&rdquo; the general
	purred smoothly.  &ldquo;They're blinded right now with our jamming,
	so they can't possibly know just how badly we have them outnumbered.
	 But when they see us coming, they'll pull out and run just as they
	always do.  So we're going to need to move in from three sides, so
	they'll be pinned.  I want you to tell the center column to slow up
	and let the left and right wings catch up on the flanks.  Coordinate
	to move up and attack the golf course at exactly the same time.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes sir.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner nodded.  The strategy was
	sound.  It would go for maximum kill ratio.  General Nelsen
	certainly wasn't squeamish.  Better to get this over with as fast as
	possible.  They had a lot of loyal Federation citizens to avenge. 
	And then it would be on to other business.  Like resuming the
	tearing down of the cyberverse and the rebuilding of the state in

	 At that range they couldn't penetrate their body armor, but the

	being sucked into an ambush, and her squad was gradually

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The simmering flush of combat

	exactly where or when the bloodbath would take place.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Abruptly they ran out of ground

	hot pursuit of enemies they didn't even have a month ago.  Reverend
	Cleary and the other Order leaders were careful to keep their own
	people in special regiments separate from the Federation's men, but
	since they functioned in the field under joint command, on a
	practical level there was little difference.  They got issued with
	the same weapons and equipment, received the same training, pulled
	the same duties.  All that onward Christian soldiers stuff wasn't
	just metaphor anymore.  Still, what could you do?   It wasn't like a

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Shooting heretics, sending them on

	and repeat.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Brig was scanning the sides of the
	street ahead for any telltale shimmers or suddenly firing snipers.  
	He was totally keyed up.  They'd already lost two men, but that was
	earlier on when the exchange of gunfire had been at closer range.  A
	part of Josh which he didn't want to examine too closely was
	relieved that the enemy were cowards who were too scared to get in
	range to penetrate their body armor with a direct shot.   These
	weird vibrations that he could feel through the soles of his boots
	every few seconds, and that seemed to hum in his skull behind his

	while now, and they'd all begun to tune it out.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The lieutenant was shouting

	had an army?  Suddenly, Josh realized that a lot of separate
	Federation contingents were meeting up at this one end of the golf
	course, coming together like a confluence of rivers.  Shit, they
	must have better than ten thousand guys here now.  Brig grinned at
	him, and Josh gave him a thumbs-up sign back.  They were gonna kick
	some <I>ass</I> now!  Then maybe all this would be over for a spell.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There were these floating platform
	doohickeys over there, that looked like those old pontoon barges
	people used to put out on lakes that you could swim out to, except
	these were way up in the air.  He figured they must be for some kind
	of protection, and the enemy must be hiding beneath them.  Sure
	enough, as soon as all their guys arrived and formed up, they
	started heading that way.   Josh checked his weapon and adjusted his
	belt as they jogged along, swiping a swallow out of his canteen too.
	 Damn but it was hot out here, and this was April?  He would never
	understand why people wanted to live in a freaking desert.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What was left of greens and
	fairways, that the desert had not taken back, was soon destroyed by
	thousands of marching booted feet.   They could see the enemy now,
	it looked like a couple thousand of them, just standing there
	waiting, all in their white.  On an almost subconscious level, it
	bothered Josh that the enemy always dressed in white.  White was
	supposed to be for the good guys.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A kind of breathless enthusiasm
	spread invisibly from man to man as the enemy continued to just
	stand there passively as they approached.   Without the need for
	further orders, they began to charge, picking up the pace and
	shouting, bellowing, then screaming wordlessly at the mustered
	vigilantes.  The men fanned out, with a yard or two spread around
	each man, so that they wouldn't be so much in one another's line of
	fire.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Brig and Josh were in one of the
	forward companies, but not at the very front, so when the men ahead
	of them stopped running and started walking forward firing, they
	were able to see clearly what range they'd need to achieve.   In a
	fight like this, one infantry formation against another, only the
	soldiers in the front line of each force could use full auto safely
	without hitting their own men.  The ones behind had to use single
	shots only and aim between or over their fellows.  With their
	color-coded scope sights, that wasn't as hard as it sounded, nor as
	error prone.  If Josh's weapon was pointing at a friendly target,
	his viewfinder glowed red, went white if he had no target, and
	turned green the instant he was sighted on a bona fide hostile.   He
	picked out a Sing near the front and squeezed off a couple of shots
	when he saw the crosshairs flash green.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Nothing!  He'd swear he must have
	hit him, but the dude just stood there swaying, calmly firing back. 
	Their body armor couldn't be that good at this range, not against
	the piercing hollowpoints he was using.  Hell, it looked more like
	spandex than armor anyway.   All the Sing dudes looked like they
	were dancing or something, leaning this way and that, bending and
	ducking and flexing in what looked like random ways, sometimes
	sharply in a blur but mostly pretty casual.  They couldn't possibly
	be dodging bullets, could they?  In any case, the guys in the enemy
	front ranks weren't falling &ndash; but plenty of their own front
	line men were.  Some were obviously hit, while others were just
	hitting the deck and getting down to fire from a safer prone
	position.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Brig suddenly looked up and
	gasped, and Josh looked up in the air and saw it too.  A whole pack
	of remote-controlled Federation drones were flying like a swarm over
	the Sing positions.  They started dropping ordinance.  That was
	gonna hurt.  Which must explain why their charge had stopped well
	short of point-blank range.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Josh had also wondered why they
	weren't charging around to flank the enemy and surround them, since
	they had so many men here, and now he saw the answer to that, too. 
	Two more large bodies of Federation troops were rushing the Sings
	from both sides, at least five thousand more troops per side.  And
	holy hell, the ones on the right side had an armor brigade with
	them.  Man, those tanks could move!  It was hard to believe that
	something that big could tool along that quickly.  Those tanks were
	gonna slice right into the enemy formation, guns blazing.   This was
	gonna be a massacre.  Josh almost felt sorry for those poor

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif"><I>Right on
	schedule</I>, Clay thought, amused.  He couldn't have worked out
	this timing any better if he was giving the enemy their orders
	himself.   The Federation infantry was split into three groups,
	attacking simultaneously from south, east, and west.  The southern
	force was over twice as large as the other two, with the armored
	vehicles on the east side.   Enemy bomber drones were now hitting
	them from above.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay threw a switch that triggered
	their signal jamming equipment.  Now that the enemy commanders had
	managed to get their forces here in such a beautifully coordinated
	fashion, there was no longer any reason to allow them to communicate
	with their men.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Cyberantes' own drones could
	easily have taken out the Federation's remote-controlled fliers, but
	doing that too soon might have made them reluctant to attempt a
	headlong charge without air support.   The microburst generators on
	the overhead platforms shunted aside every piece of ordinance the
	drones dropped.  The bombs bounced away in random directions, but
	since there were enemy troopers covering the ground on three sides
	of them, it was inevitable that the majority of the resulting
	explosions rained down death on Federation forces rather than their
	intended targets.  With their remote control communications links
	jammed, the bomber drones shifted to onboard AI piloting, and in the
	absence of new orders to the contrary, dutifully continued making
	passes at their last designated targets.   As wave after wave of
	falling bombs caromed into the Federation ranks, the Federation
	troopers hit the deck, ran in circles, or fled in terror, only to be
	hemmed in by their own men still streaming in behind them.   Some of
	them even started shooting up at their own drones, desperately
	trying to disable them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cyberantes commandos on the east
	flank lobbed a swarm of sawbots from their utility belts at the
	incoming tanks, programmed to slice through their treads, then
	remove their guns.  In about ten seconds the armored vehicles were
	all immobilized and helpless.   Only one tank actually reached their
	perimeter before it lurched and skidded to a halt in a cloud of
	sand.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was time for the next phase, so
	Clay tripped another control which summoned their own dragonfly
	drones, still patrolling nearby, to take out the enemy bombers.   As
	soon as that task was completed, he gave his next order.  The third
	of the Cyberantes forces that were mounted on air bikes, who had
	been clustered on the north side and screened by their fellows, now
	rose into the air.  Fanning out over the enemy forces, they sprayed
	them with high-caliber automatic weapons fire from about fifty feet
	up.  At that close range, Federation body armor was all but useless.
	  The carnage was dreadful.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Inevitably, the enemy began to
	break ranks and flee in all directions, desperate to run out from
	under all the death falling from above, pelting toward the nearest
	houses, longing to get clear of the golf course, which had become a
	killing field.   Abruptly, the flying bikes ceased firing, as Clay
	issued another set of orders.   The Federation troops, however, did
	not stop running.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not until the Cyberantes troops
	unstealthed right in front of them, thousands more of them who had
	drawn a ring around the golf course on all sides, standing there in
	their white with weapons leveled, blocking every possible exit.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Throw down your weapons!&rdquo;
	a stentorian voice boomed over the battlefield.  &ldquo;Surrender
	and you will not be harmed!&rdquo;  The only reaction which
	prevailed was confusion.  Some few did as they were bidden.  Some
	stood, still clutching their weapons, unsure what to do.  Some
	veered and tried to run a different way, then ended up jogging in
	circles as they empirically verified that every escape route was
	indeed blocked off.  Still others decided to engage the encircling
	Sings, struggling to fight their way out.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Cyberantes had unstealthed at
	a range where their superior weapons and body armor gave them a
	crippling advantage, and they were taking no chances.  They opened
	up on any Feds who threatened to get too close, driving them back.  
	But in a few places, knots of determined troopers managed to break
	containment.   The fliers pursued these, gunning them down from
	behind as they ran.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">At length an unspoken consensus
	was reached among the Federation survivors, and giving up suddenly

	Federation had anticipated.  Which was disturbing, but that wasn't
	the worst of it.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The worst of it was the
	realization that they'd been played, big time.  That <I>he'd </I>been
	played.  That somebody knew how the Federation leaders thought, and
	had been able to grease the skids for them so they'd make every
	mistake possible.   Sure, their troops had been outclassed and
	outfought.  But worst of all, they'd been out thought.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Even when he was a kid, Sarner
	hated losing.  He'd always demanded a do-over anytime he felt he'd
	made a really stupid mistake.   He wanted to do this battle over so
	badly he quaked with it.  His thoughts spun around in his head like
	a fever dream, watching it all spiral out of control, denying,
	wanting it to go different, back to watching his men being
	slaughtered, no, no!  Go back and do it again, this can't be right. 
	The end result was a kind of numbness that imprisoned his thoughts
	so that he could scarcely do anything.  It took a major effort even
	to speak.  He'd never been so angry that he couldn't even lash out
	at somebody.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">General Nelsen sat next to him at
	the table, equally subdued, as their command tank raced through the
	streets of Phoenix at nearly its top velocity, desperately trying to
	get back to the west edge of town where their air transports waited,
	so they could return to headquarters.  There was no guarantee that
	they'd get there, of course.  This vehicle seemed like no protection
	whatsoever anymore.  Sarner had watched on the view screen, almost
	disbelieving, as some kind of belt grenade things took out tanks in
	seconds.  And those drones knocked out combat aircraft just as
	quick.  When they'd set off driving at top speed, everyone had been
	expecting something to stop them almost immediately.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Nothing did, which in a way only
	made Sarner feel worse.  It suggested they were escaping only
	because the enemy permitted it.   Somewhere out there, some
	motherfucking Sing bastard was laughing at him, because he, Roger
	Sarner, had fucked up so badly.  And was happy he was getting away
	because that meant he would continue in charge of the Federation and
	could doubtless be counted on to fuck up again.  Which made every
	rocking lurch of this tank on its suspension feel like an insult.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner absolutely <I>hated </I>being
	responsible for anything that went wrong.  And while it looked now
	like he was going to escape from the battle, he couldn't escape from
	that.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	firm hug as he stepped off his hovering command scooter.   This had
	gone well today, but they were both relieved that it was over.  
	Neither of them had any love of killing or of giving orders that
	were going to get other people made dead.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay looked over the bloody, still
	bodies that lay strewn in droves over acres of prime land that had
	once served for innocent recreation.   He shook his head.   &ldquo;I
	wish to God these assholes would just leave us alone,&rdquo; he said
	in a low voice.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma took his hand.  &ldquo;You

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay nodded.  &ldquo;I know, and

	proud of what we had to do here today.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma peeled off her mask, then

	proud of it,&rdquo; she whispered.  &ldquo;You're a good man, Clay
	Thorsten.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It no longer troubled him that the
	woman now in his arms didn't look all that much like the Salma
	Rivera he knew so well.  So she had opted for a bit more of a
	makeover with her virtual self than he had done.  So what?  Like
	everyone, he'd heard the adage that beauty was only skin deep.  But
	there was also a kind of corollary to that, that real inner beauty
	came out in any form.  After what they'd done together, here in real
	space, he knew that their bond of love would deepen into an ever
	more profound and satisfying partnership.  And he no longer doubted
	that she felt the same.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Things were blinking at the edges
	of Clay's vision, probably because other people had discovered that
	he was no longer responding to messages sent to his external command
	console.  There were a thousand loose ends to tie up.  He took
	Salma's hand and started walking toward his responsibilities.  But
	in a strange way, he felt that he'd been through a kind of purging
	or tempering fire.  He no longer thought of this world as the
	future, or even as the most important world.   He wanted better
	worlds.  And he knew that together he and Salma would find them, or

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Joshua sat on a
	stool next to Brig's pallet in the makeshift hospital.   Brig wasn't
	too bad off, just took a bullet in his left shoulder, but his face
	looked a little strained as he slept, the pain not quite breaking
	through the mild tranquilizer he'd been given.  Josh himself was
	miraculously unscathed.   All that destruction falling from the sky
	like the wrath of God, diving into craters that weren't there a
	second ago, rolling over dead men and severed limbs, and yet the
	worst thing that had happened to him was to discover when he came to
	that his last meal was satcheled in his uniform trousers.   God sure
	must love him, when so many others hadn't been so lucky.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He'd found Brigham nearby,
	bleeding and dazed, but alive.   Those Sing heretics made them
	disarm and take off their helmets, but after that they were actually
	surprisingly nice, offering them food, water, and medical attention
	without any evidence of rancor.   Josh had never been in a battle
	before (and sincerely hoped he never was again) but he'd always
	figured that forgive and forget didn't set in till a long time
	afterwards.   And if these Sings were really the spawn of Satan, why
	were they being so considerate in the first place?  It was like as
	soon as the shooting stopped, they were ready to make up and be
	friends.  Which was weirder than hell because they were all acting
	pretty much like Jesus would have wanted them to.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Brig had been offered some Sing
	nanobots which the doc &ndash; this little chick who was actually
	really cute &ndash; said would patch him up from the inside in
	nothing flat.  But he'd refused, citing religious objections, and
	she'd shrugged, removed the bullet, bandaged him up, and given him
	some plain antibiotics and the sedative instead.  Josh had expected
	the lady doc to laugh and inject Brig with the medical bots anyhow,
	instead of respecting his wishes.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Now Josh was sorely confused.  
	Nothing ever happened that wasn't the will of God, and that was a
	fact.  So what were they supposed to do now?   He looked at Brig and
	watched his chest rise and fall softly, and couldn't figure out why
	the two of them were still alive when so many others weren't.  <I>Did
	you save us for some special reason, Lord?</I> he wondered at the

	what the reason might be.</FONT></DIV>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Bright neon
	signage contrasted starkly with dark walls and polished black
	floors, glittering with myriad reflections.  Black light flared on
	painted signs, on posters, and on the clothing of the seething mass
	of patrons.  A soundscape as garish and diverse as the lighting
	assaulted the ears.  Torch made his way carefully around the arcade,
	keeping to the middle of the two-way traffic stream, away from the
	numerous barkers and hustlers positioned in front of businesses of
	unusual, and frequently dubious, character.   If the Mall of the
	Western Hemisphere constituted a hub of demure, respectable
	commerce, the Dark Palace served the wants of the flip side.  If the
	Mall was a staid white market, the Palace was an exotic black one,
	where absolutely anything and everything was for sale.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Based on the appearance of the
	people packing the concentric rings of its endless arcade, which
	went on level after level and mile after mile, Torch would have
	guessed that it lay in Thailand, or perhaps some other southeast
	Asian country.  There were also Africans, Latins, westerners like
	himself, and even some middle-easterners among the patrons, creating
	a mixture as diverse as the vegetables in one of those eclectic Thai
	curries.  In fact it was not unknown to see avatars here which did
	not appear human at all; that lycanthrope walking into an ecstasy
	shop, for example.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Actually of course the Dark Palace
	existed only in virtuality, just as the Mall did.   Torch found that
	the atmosphere of the Palace became oppressive after a while.   The
	sea of alien humanity forced him to confront the uncomfortable
	reality that the cultural values of his own background held little
	sway among the great mass of people on the planet.   The cyberverse
	reflected the wants and needs of those who populated it; and these
	days, the majority of those residents were non-western.  It pained
	him to think, for example, how few Believers probably surrounded him
	in this place.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The markings winking on a pillar
	at an intersection showed him that he was drawing near to his
	destination.  He was on the correct level now, and less than fifteen
	degrees of arc away around the vast rink.  The 3D polar coordinate
	system used in the Palace took some getting used to.  The section he
	was now walking through was largely given over to gambling
	establishments.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Contemporary bettors seldom
	wagered on anything as simplistic as cards or dice anymore.  The
	fact that <I>everyone</I> could count cards and compute favorable
	odds in their heads took all the fun out of simple games of chance,
	by dint of harmonizing the bets laid.  So bets were taken on the
	outcome of more complex circumstances, possessing a high degree of
	variance and randomness.  One could lay bets on the occurrence of
	events in thousands of virtualities where outcomes were determined
	by the interactions among participants sometimes numbering in the
	millions, or on events in real reality, or even on such trivia as
	when a particular atom in a certain radioactive isotope sample was
	going to decay, a game known as Heisenberg roulette.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Many of the circumstances on which
	one could lay bets correlated with some economic outcome, such as
	the success or failure of a company or a new invention, or the
	likelihood of a particular loan being paid back.   With the ubiquity
	of what were called predictive markets, the boundary between
	speculation and gambling had blurred almost beyond recognition.  
	Casinos sometimes sold bonds, while brokerages took wagers, writing
	underlying contracts on the fly where necessary.   The augmented
	pattern recognition and statistical computation abilities of the
	general population made everyone and his Paia into a potential
	market guru.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The trouble was that everyone else
	had the same capabilities, which tended to create a regression
	series of derivative bets based on other bets.  Inevitably,
	complexity and unpredictability were leveraged to a point where even
	super-intelligences employing comprehensive statistical models could
	no longer reliably predict the outcome, and so there the betting
	stopped.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Supposedly, it all made the
	allocation of capital that much more efficient.  Which was
	important, since electronic money could no longer be created out of
	thin air and the amount of available capital was therefore finite,
	drawn from savings rather than from borrowing.  Markets could now
	react in minutes to altered circumstances that might have required
	months or even years to accommodate in the past.  But for the most
	part, it all made Torch's head spin.  He didn't believe in gambling,
	and as a rule investing scared him because a lot of the time he
	could barely tell the difference.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">An odds board in a bookie
	establishment which he was passing advertised that the North
	American Federation now stood at 763.85 to 1 to defeat the
	Cyberantes.   He scowled, annoyed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">His destination was now in sight:
	a cambio boutique which exchanged among various cyberverse
	currencies.   They also featured a coffee shop which served a
	fabulous cup of chai.   He had not been here since late last autumn.
	  The boutique looked unchanged.   Likewise his purpose.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch had once come here to meet a
	man, an important contact, the same dude who'd given him the High
	Sing cryptokey which had transported him and his friends to the New
	York simulation.  Torch had never heard from him again, until just
	yesterday, when the man had suddenly requested this urgent meeting.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch found his man seated at the
	coffee bar, a few stools apart from any  other patrons.  He sat down
	next to him and offered him a quick nod.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Taylor McGivens jerked his head at
	Torch in return, and took another pull from his mug.  He  was
	imbibing some kind of chai, but spiked with something pretty potent
	which teased Torch's nostrils from several feet away.  McGivens
	appeared much as Torch had seen him last: rather nondescript in
	jeans and worn leather jacket, scruffy short beard and mustache,
	longish brown hair, with a slightly dissipated look.  Torch had
	concluded the first time they met that it was a calculated pose, and
	today's second look only reinforced that opinion.   McGivens was
	obviously someone important who wanted to pretend that he wasn't.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch got some hot chai of his own
	(unspiked) and looked pointedly at McGivens, waiting for him to take
	the initiative.  He had, after all, requested this meeting.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Mr. Torch, the people I
	work for don't much like violence.&rdquo;  The Scottish burr in his
	speech was slight.  Torch wasn't sure how to take this comment.  A
	warning, a threat, a rationalization? </FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And?&rdquo;
	he asked neutrally.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And so, they're looking for
	another solution, y' see.   One where no one else gets hurt.  In
	real life, I mean.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well, I'm all for that,&rdquo;
	replied Torch.  &ldquo;How can I help?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">McGivens took another pull, set
	his mug down.  &ldquo;You can pass on some information, is what.&rdquo;
	 He paused.  &ldquo;Very important information, very special.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And very secret, no doubt. 
	You know Taylor, I have to ask myself, why are Mr. McGivens'
	employers so eager to tell me secrets?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">McGivens turned to face him and
	smirked in a friendly way.  &ldquo;I expect because they want the
	secrets t' reach those you're going to share 'em with.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Really.  And who is that?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well.  I expect we could
	start with your father, Daniel.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch froze, his gaze fixed on
	Taylor McGivens.  His avatar's heart pounded.  This man obviously
	worked for the Sings.   If they knew who he was, had he been lured
	here so they could kill him?  But no, that was impossible.  Lethal
	weapons didn't function in the Dark Palace except in dueling
	grounds, and only when both parties agreed to their use.  And even
	then, they could only inflict pain, not kill his real meatspace
	body.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No, Torch, I'm not going to
	challenge ye to a duel,&rdquo; McGivens continued, eyes sparkling
	with amusement.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But you work for&ndash;&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The enemy, in one word. 
	Yes, I do.  But what you need to understand is that th' other side
	isn't monolithic.   Not everybody agrees, or sees things the same
	way.  Now that battle in Phoenix two days back, there are some who
	helped make that happen, and were a-cheerin' for it.  But there were
	also some who were appalled by it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Because of the violence.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That's right.   An' you and
	I both know, there's gonna be a whole lot more of it, if some better
	way's not found of settlin' everybody's differences.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch found it hard to believe
	that there were any Full Sings who were anything other than ecstatic
	about how that dust-up in Phoenix had turned out.  That wasn't a
	battle; it was a massacre.  But being more than a little appalled at
	all the violence himself, he was at least willing to listen.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'd agree with that.  So
	what's the better way?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well that's the information
	I'm t' give you, and you can all do with it as you like.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Okay, shoot then.&rdquo; 
	Torch sipped his chai and looked away disinterestedly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You've probably heard that
	the cyberverse is decentralized,&rdquo; McGivens began.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That's not exactly news,
	Taylor.  Our whole problem with it is that it's so decentralized.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">McGivens shrugged.  &ldquo;But
	have ye ever wondered how it really works?  I mean, how does
	something so completely decentralized always know where to go, even
	how to route around damage, as your lot discovered a while back?  
	What if I told you that that was all a lie, just a convenient bit of
	propaganda?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch shot a look at him.  &ldquo;I'd
	answer that it's a pretty damn convincing bit of propaganda, because
	it tallies with everything we've ever observed about it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And that's what they want
	you t' think, lad.  That's what they want everyone t' think.  But
	the fact is mate, that the cyberverse works because there's a
	central registry of nodes.  When a node comes online, it broadcasts
	about itself, and that broadcast is picked up and fed back into the
	master registry.   You can find an' access any virtuality in the
	cyberverse because what the system is really doing is quietly
	accessing that registry.   It's all set up so that th' leaf nodes
	don't know about other leaves that aren't on their branch, but in
	the end the only reason the leaves are all together on the same tree
	is because their branches are all connected t' the same trunk.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch digested this for a moment. 
	It sounded superficially plausible, but he didn't see yet just how
	this was helpful.  It was an interesting theory, that was all.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Interesting theory.  But
	how does it help us?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I would ha' thought that
	was obvious.   You have the Master Node List, you know where
	everything is.  You could find the hardware hosting where we are
	right now.  You could find anything.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch was thunderstruck.  What a
	weapon, if this were true!  He looked directly at McGivens now,
	trying to form an estimate of his veracity.  &ldquo;I guess that
	begs for the question: who controls the central registry?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">McGivens nodded slowly.  &ldquo;That
	is indeed th' question.  The answer is that Justin Turrell wrote the
	code a long time ago.  The DR.OS Protocols.  An' so everybody, all
	the Full Sings, they're all beholden to him.   He holds the keys to
	everyone's information.  Because only he, or those he deputizes,
	have access to the registry.   The ultimate control is his, because
	he built the system.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch frowned.  &ldquo;I thought
	Turrell always enjoyed a good reputation among the Sings.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">O' course!  And so he did. 
	 The man who sparked the growth of virtuality by making it all
	possible.  The first real, true, Full Sing, the first t' become a
	completely artificial intelligence.  Without a body.  He got others
	t' do it too, and recruited thousands of allies that way.  But he's
	always been the one more equal than others.  And what's going on
	now, it's completely terrifying.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What's going on now?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Why, this Last Trumpet
	business.   Hundreds o' thousands now, and they're all pure AIs, but
	they're not people gave up their bodies, they're dead people who
	shouldn't even be alive.   And they're all Turrell's followers.   He
	couldn't get th' whole human race to roll over and become like him,
	so now he's creating his own race of AIs by scanning the dead.  And
	they'll all live in his cyber-system, with him controlling the
	registry.  Pretty soon there'll be so many of 'em that the rest of
	us won't matter.  Don't you see how that makes him the next thing t'
	God?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch had to admit that this line
	of thinking jibed with what his old man thought, not about Justin
	Turrell specifically, but about the Full Sings in general.  &ldquo;And
	so what you're telling me is that some of the other Full Sings are
	disturbed by this plan?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Aye, that's what I'm
	tellin' ye.  And the Moshes, they should be even more disturbed. 
	You see, once you go the Full Sing route, ye can't come back.   And
	so Justin wants everyone to have t' become like him.  That means
	either they convert themselves over, or they get killed and scanned.
	 But y' see, he can't just wipe out all the Moshes in a bloodbath.  
	He needs a pretext to justify th' killing.  Needs a civil war in
	meatspace, which will go on till everyone's dead.  Then they all res
	up into his virtual universe, and he'll have everybody living his
	way in his bailiwick.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch found this narrative almost
	sickeningly disturbing.  He took a long bracing drink from his
	cooling cup of chai.   It all made a kind of sense, especially when
	he thought about what the Cyberantes were ostensibly doing.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I can see in your face that
	I've struck a chord in ye.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch nodded reluctantly.  &ldquo;I
	was just thinking about what some of my Sing friends are doing.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Meaning your friends Clay

	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes.  Stefan.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Th' same man, a friend o'

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch fell silent, considering.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I wouldn't blame your

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch shook his head.  &ldquo;Oh,
	I don't.  They think they're doing right.&rdquo;  There was still
	something he had to know, to complete the picture forming in his

	revealed to them of Turrell's megalomania, and they want to stop his

	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That's righ'.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So why give us this

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">McGivens looked at him steadily
	and spoke very softly.   &ldquo;Because you're free to go into the
	cyberverse to find th' Master Node List.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But why can't your bosses
	do that?  Surely they'd be a lot better suited for it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Ordinarily, you'd be right.
	 But think about it.  If Justin catches somebody lookin' for the

	could just shut down that system for good, and prob'ly even blame
	your dad's lot for it.  But you people who still have bodies, he
	can't shut those down.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch raised his eyebrows.  It
	seemed a curious twist of fate that there was still something a Mosh
	could do that even a Full Sing couldn't.  But it made sense.  As
	long as there were bio-Sings out there who could jack into the
	cyberverse, Justin would be vulnerable if anybody ever found his
	List.  But there was still one aspect that didn't make sense.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">If my dad and Roger Sarner
	ever get hold of this registry List, you know what they'll do with
	it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Aye.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So why aren't your
	employers worried about that?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Eyes twinkling, McGivens
	explained: &ldquo;Because we're building a new generation of
	computers that won't be part of the DR.OS network.  Only, we can't
	deploy 'em yet without tipping our hand.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch was sold, but he knew his
	father might not be.  &ldquo;But that means&ndash;&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That you'd never be able t'
	destroy the whole cyberverse.  There'd still be a part you couldn't
	touch.  Quite true.   We're not prepared to let you destroy our part
	of it.  But you're welcome t' destroy Justin's portion.  Which is
	everything that exists now.  After that, we don't have any
	ambitions.  We're willing to let the Moshes live biological, as
	human beings were meant to live.  Those of us who aren't human
	anymore will continue t' survive in our own fashion.  We don't want
	to run th' world, or bring everyone else into ours.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch considered his options for
	only a moment.  &ldquo;All right.  I'll take this message for you. 
	But even if our leadership goes for it, we wouldn't know the first
	place to start looking for this List.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Of course ye wouldn't. 
	Justin's countin' on that.  But we're working on it.  You decide you
	want t' go after it, you let me know and you'll have some help.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Fine.  Thank you, Mr.
	McGivens.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">My pleasure, Mr. Torch.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch shook Taylor's hand, tossed
	off what was left of his chai, and stalked into the cambio side of
	the establishment, striving to conceal the elation that he felt.  
	He was brought up short by the exchange rate posted on the board for
	ameros.  The NAF currency had lost ninety percent of its value
	versus all of the metals-based units since he last tried to exchange
	some, a couple of weeks ago.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Excuse me, that Amero to
	Aurumnet rate can't be right,&rdquo; he said to the attendant, who
	like almost all retail clerks was clearly a NPC.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The posted rate is correct,
	sir,&rdquo; the attendant replied crisply.  &ldquo;There has been a
	recent coup in the Federation, and the new leadership is borrowing
	money into circulation like there was no tomorrow.  They have also
	abandoned the charitable projects which elicit the donations that
	are the government's major source of revenue, making it likely that
	the currency will soon lose all value.  If you have any ameros, I
	would highly recommend that you exchange them while there is still a
	speculative market for them, sir.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Oh, all right, I'll take it
	then,&rdquo; Torch said reluctantly.  Damn, this was inconvenient. 
	He surrendered his banking datapad, having authorized it for almost
	his entire account balance.  As the attendant gave it back to him
	along with a wallet filled with freshly minted Aurumnet digital
	coins, he reflected glumly that he was going to have to watch
	expenses carefully from now on.  Unlike his girlfriend, he had no
	regular source of income within the cyberverse.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As he left the boutique for the
	glowing, ever-crowded hallways outside, he reflected that the good
	news was that achieving the quest for the Master Node List could
	also win him his girl.  Cylara insisted she wanted them to be
	together only in the cyberverse.  But if it got destroyed, would she
	settle for a life together in reality?  Torch was willing to bet
	that she would.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He wondered idly whether he could
	find a bookie on this street who'd take that bet.  As he hastened
	along the concourse toward the nearest Dark Palace exit zone point,
	he found himself much less bothered by his surroundings.  He knew
	now that there was a chance all of this would go up in smoke someday
	soon.   Knowing that, he could feel set apart from the human flood
	around him, those for whom the end of all this glamorous wickedness
	never entered their darkest dream.   If it was all temporary, it
	need not distress him so much.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch zoned out of the Palace
	without regret, bent on completing just a few more errands in
	virtuality while he was still jacked in.  Then he would head
	straight to a face-to-face meeting with his father.  It seemed their
	prayers had at last been answered.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Taylor McGivens
	rose from his stool and ambled down the concourse toward the nearest
	zone point.  He'd performed a lot of odd jobs for his employer
	recently.  He'd noticed that that weird installation he'd done in
	Labrador had gotten bombed out on 3/3, and put it together that it
	was somehow because of that kid back in the cambio.  In which case,
	all that blither he'd just fed the kid had to be intended to get the

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The sun blazed
	down on the orbiting platform, slanting in at a sharp angle.  Only
	recently had it cleared the curve of the Earth's horizon.  The
	portion of the planet below that lay west of the terminator &ndash;
	the waist of South America &ndash; was still in shadow.   Tinted
	glass took the place of atmosphere in moderating the flood of solar
	energy that poured into the control chamber, but the dawn was still
	gloriously bright.  Outside the panoramic windows, a streamlined but
	squat shape waited on a flat metal launching pad, like a motionless
	platinum bird with its wings folded.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Professor Sky carefully monitored
	the readings on a complex holographic instrument panel.  Members of
	her research team clustered around her or studied their own
	consoles.   Justin and Riksana sat among the small company of
	spectators, beneath one of the huge space-backed windows.   A
	portable holodisplay hovered in front of them, passively replicating
	some of the systems instrument data feeds.  In view at the moment
	was a glowing white sphere, which appeared to be levitating at the
	center of a minor electrical storm, like something out of a crude
	Tesla demonstration.  Numbers streamed by beneath the image, at
	thousands of digits per second.  Riksana read the numbers, which
	were raw telemetry data, fed them into a matrix of governing
	equations, and solved the matrix in her head, updating it in real
	time as the data flowed by.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The wormhole mouth is
	certainly stable,&rdquo; she murmured after several minutes.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin sighed.  &ldquo;Of course

	be going ahead with the countdown if it weren't.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well, I don't know enough
	about the engineering of the photonic stardrive to check up on the
	readiness of <I>that</I>,&rdquo; Riksana laughed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The holographic rendering of the
	electrified sphere depicted the state of an actual object which was
	aboard the <I>Thorne</I>, the spacefaring vessel being readied for
	launch outside the window.  The sphere was an energized
	superconductor which served to prop open one end of a stabilized
	wormhole.  An identical sphere, which held open the opposite end,
	was located only a few dozen meters away in a chamber elsewhere on
	the orbiting launch platform.   The wormhole created between them
	had been expanded from its original subatomic size to a width of
	nearly a nanometer.   The spheres expended energy to maintain and
	stabilize the wormhole, at a rate that would remain constant
	regardless of how distantly separated the two endpoints might
	become.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In truth they were going to end up
	very far apart indeed.  As soon as Professor Sky and her team
	completed their preflight checks, the <I>Thorne</I> would be on its
	way to the Rigil Kentaurus system, more colloquially known by its
	Bayer designation, Alpha Centauri.  By emitting a continuous stream
	of high-energy photons, the ship's engine would gradually accelerate
	the ship to a speed very nearly approaching that of light.  
	Although Centauri was 4.37 light-years from Earth, the journey would
	take only ten weeks, ship time.   Because the stretched wormhole
	would maintain a coterminous link between the temporal reference
	frames of its two endpoints, it would become possible to transmit
	data instantly between Earth and the <I>Thorne</I> in the Centauri
	system only ten weeks from now.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In addition to the stabilized
	wormhole mouth, the <I>Thorne</I> carried a complement of
	exploration nanobots.  Networked to the ship's onboard AI, the
	nanobots were capable of erecting and replicating molecular
	structures on any suitable planetoid or asteroid within the system. 
	 The remote scans of the system indicated that there were at least
	two stable, terrestrial planets orbiting Alpha Centauri, with at
	least one more such rocky object orbiting nearby Beta Centauri. 
	Spectrographic analysis showed that necessary elemental raw
	materials would be abundant. Initially, the nanobot swarm would
	fabricate molecular circuitry and solar cells.  That, plus the
	instantaneous transmission capabilities of the wormhole, would give
	Sing culture a foothold in the system.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The imagination of human
	scientists and writers and futurists had long been captivated by the
	possibility of discovering Earth-like planets which the human race
	could colonize.   But in the event, by the time human technology
	actually launched the first interstellar space probe &ndash; in a
	few minutes hence &ndash; the requirement that the destination
	astral bodies must be class M planets capable of supporting life, no
	longer existed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin couldn't help but find the
	irony amusing.  This control room was, of course, an exact
	simulation of the orbital launch station, a virtual world linked in
	real time to sensors and control interfaces physically resident on
	the actual station above the Earth in real space.  Someday soon, if
	all went well, an analogous simulation would allow him (and anyone
	else who desired to do so) to experience being on Alpha Centauri II
	in real time.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana continued to monitor the
	various data feeds being emitted by the <I>Thorne</I> and its launch
	control systems.   She was not, however, oblivious to her
	companion's mood.   &ldquo;You seem very thoughtful.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I was just reflecting that

	think you're only humorless when you try to joke.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Ooh.  Tough crowd.&rdquo; 
	She flicked him an amused glance.  &ldquo;Looks like the stardrive's
	preflights are all completed.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sure enough, Professor Sky was
	settling back in her chair, expressing satisfaction.  Then she rose
	and faced the small audience, who accorded her their full attention.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">More than seventy-five
	years ago,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;Neil Armstrong said that the
	first footstep on the moon was a small step for a man, but a giant
	leap for mankind.   Today we continue that tradition by making
	another giant leap, this time across interstellar space.  
	Completing this leap will allow human culture to begin its expansion
	across the physical universe.  On behalf of the Centauri Foundation,
	I would like to thank all of you who have contributed to this
	effort, and given of your time, talents, and money to bring it to
	fruition.  Your support has enabled us to cross the chasm between

	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I am now going to set a two
	minute countdown, after which the <I>Thorne's</I> AI, named Kip,
	will be free to launch the ship.  Please get yourselves into a good

	triggered the countdown, to a round of polite applause.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin and Riksana abandoned the
	telemetry displays and moved to stand, side by side, before one of
	the tall glass panels facing the ship.  This was an important moment
	for them as well, because the <I>Thorne</I> also carried some very
	special software of theirs that would be put to use at the other end
	of the journey.  A kind of experiment within the experiment.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Heightened abilities to process
	sensory inputs and ponder their meaning and significance tended to
	result in the extension of subjective time, so that events which in
	fact took only moments might be perceived as occurring in slow
	motion.   Most of those present chose to savor the event by turning
	up the resolution on their perceptions.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin and Riksana, lightly
	sharing thoughts and impressions between them as they often did when
	together, saw the flare of the chemical rocket thrusters that
	maneuvered the <I>Thorne</I> off its launch pad and eased it to a
	safe distance away from the orbiting station.  At that point, with
	the ship still resembling a vehicle rather than a point of light,
	Kip shifted the engines to ion emission mode.  While the ship was
	traveling slowly and within the solar system, it would eject ionized
	plasma consisting of light atoms such as xenon, moving at speeds
	much less than that of light.  Once it had cleared the gravity wells
	of both Earth and the Sun, the engines would be switched to
	stardrive mode, emitting streams of photons, almost massless
	particles traveling at light-speed.  The initiation of that flight
	mode would not be visible, of course.  The same series of engine
	modalities would be used in reverse to decelerate and land the
	<I>Thorne</I> once it reached Centauri.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Under ion propulsion the ship
	quickly swung out of view, taking a parabolic course downward over
	the south pole and sheer away from the orbital plane of the solar
	system.  Its silvery dot flicked like a shooting star as it
	disappeared.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Bon voyage, Kip,&rdquo;
	Starry Sky called after it.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Thank you, Professor,&rdquo;
	came the voice of the AI pilot over the audio link.  &ldquo;All

	then much hugging and shaking of hands all around.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">When the social amenities had been
	duly observed, Justin and Riksana zoned back to her aerie.  &ldquo;Well,
	it's good to have the <I>Thorne</I> on its way,&rdquo; she offered
	cheerfully.  &ldquo;Starry was kind enough to allot me an encrypted
	channel through the wormhole directly to Kip, so I'll be able to
	keep in touch with him and upload any software updates.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Nifty.  Speaking of the

	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Exactly, sir,&rdquo; Daniel

	&ldquo;The data is stored somewhere in a virtual world,&rdquo;
	Daniel went on.  &ldquo;We don't yet know which one, but my sources

	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That makes sense,&rdquo;
	Sarner admitted.  Then he shook his head.  This whole business about
	relying on cyberverse intel from some splinter group among the Full

	of getting outmaneuvered by non-biological intelligence, and his

	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They're the only ones we

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner nodded.  &ldquo;I
	understood all that.  But you know, this could all be some kind of
	stall, a wild goose chase aimed at keeping us from doing something
	more effective.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The elder Cleary looked at him
	through his glasses, eyes widening in soundless exposition of every

	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I don't know,&rdquo; he
	sighed.  &ldquo;I gotta admit, they have us pretty well tied up.&rdquo;
	 That was the understatement of the week.   Since Phoenix five days
	ago, they could hardly make a move without some Cyberantes &ldquo;response

	subscribed to their protection racket service in the past few days. 
	His teams couldn't kick in a door anywhere at all anymore without

	alternative would have been mutiny among their own squads.  They
	just didn't want to go out anymore.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And honestly, who could blame
	them?  Sarner just couldn't get his mind around the fact that a
	bunch of cyber-anarchists had managed to muster, train, equip, and
	organize a volunteer force that could flat-out kick the asses of
	anything the legitimate authorities could put together.  Hell, these
	guys could probably have slaughtered the whole US military back in

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not to mention that it was
	impossible to close with a decentralized mobile guerrilla force even

	dedicated service by the elites, carefully guiding and restraining
	all those mad human impulses, ages of standing in the way of chaos,
	preventing humanity from annihilating itself and its world in an
	orgy of greed and reckless gratification.  And this was where that
	noble history led.  Sarner felt like he could almost see and hear
	the ghosts of his predecessors, of presidents and prosecutors,
	congressmen and kings, who gathered 'round to reproach him for his
	failures.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yet there was this one desperate
	hope left.   But was it real, or was it some kind of trick?  The
	best Sarner could figure, it almost didn't matter if it was.  They
	were about out of options anyway.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Roger, are you okay?&rdquo;
	Cleary senior asked, sounding almost solicitous.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Secretary sat up with a small
	start.  &ldquo;Yes, of course.  I'm just tired.&rdquo;  He rubbed
	his eyes in a show of weariness that was only slightly exaggerated.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Do I take it you approve
	the operation then, sir?&rdquo; Daniel asked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner made himself speak
	decisively.  &ldquo;Yes, certainly.  What kind of resources will you
	need?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Clearys exchanged a glance. 
	&ldquo;As much as you can give me,&rdquo; Daniel replied at once. 
	&ldquo;We have potentially hundreds of virtualities to search, and
	I'm the only member of the KOJ who's been fitted with virtual
	immersion gear.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I can probably round you up
	a few hundred of our people.  Turns out quite a few of our
	employees, even our best agents, have been spending their off time
	in the damned cyberverse.  Still, they won't all follow you, not
	reliably.  So I guess that means I'll be coming with you, to
	coordinate things.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Maxwell raised his eyebrows at his
	counterpart, but Daniel took it in stride, saying only: &ldquo;Very
	good, sir.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Which means I'm going to
	have to go get myself polluted with nanites,&rdquo; Sarner
	continued, with a disbelieving head shake and a frown.  &ldquo;Thank
	God it's temporary.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Indeed, we should be
	thanking God,&rdquo; Reverend Cleary averred.  &ldquo;This
	opportunity is the Almighty's doing, beyond doubt.  You see a
	potential trap, but I see the hand of divine providence.  These
	dissident Sings think they're beyond God just as they're beyond
	flesh.  But they're not.  He is manipulating them, influencing them.
	 Why else would they conspire with us to destroy their own
	cyberverse?  They're the ones going to their undoing, not us Roger.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Good must triumph over
	evil, eh?&rdquo; Sarner asked, but for the first time, he really
	didn't feel like he was mocking.  He badly needed to believe that
	they could still win.  Not compromise, not negotiate, but win.  If
	God could make that possible, he'd gladly praise God for the rest of
	his days.  He'd always believed that only the weak and the hopeless
	needed to appeal to a higher power.  But their current predicament
	was forcing him to reconsider.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I know a clinic where we
	can get you what you need done,&rdquo; Daniel offered.  &ldquo;I've
	dealt with them before.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We might be smart not to,
	ah, requisition their services,&rdquo; Sarner mused.  &ldquo;Will
	they take ameros?&rdquo; he asked sardonically.  If they did, they
	were about the last black market outfit that would.  Following its
	military defeat, the Federation's currency had collapsed totally.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel Cleary smiled.  &ldquo;Doesn't
	matter.  I've got enough gold to cover it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was ironic: now the only people
	who had money were the tax rebels inside the cyberverse.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Roger Sarner stood up from the
	rude table where they'd been sitting.  It moldered in a dusty,
	run-down warehouse, in an uninhabited part of Long Beach.  They no
	longer dared meet in a government office or a KOJ lodge.  It was too
	likely that the enemy might train the Cronus Scanner on such
	locations, in order to eavesdrop on their meeting after the fact. 
	But they could hardly scan everywhere at once, and there was no
	reason that this dump should draw any attention.  It had clearly
	been several years since anyone had even been inside.  Sarner was
	surprised the antique fluorescents overhead were still connected to
	an electrical source.   He'd picked the locks to let them in,
	practicing some of his old special agent skills from back when.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There was a message there, or at
	least a metaphor.  In cities all over the world, there were
	buildings like this, abandoned, no longer used for their original
	purpose, no longer useful at all.  Still owned by somebody no doubt,
	somebody who probably couldn't care less anymore.   Sarner had a
	sudden vision of one of those big motorized rolling file drawers
	holding land deeds by the thousand, situated in a forsaken building
	every bit as dusty and deserted as this one.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Desperation was making him
	maudlin.  He needed to watch that.  &ldquo;It'll be a couple of
	weeks before we can get rolling on this, I'm afraid.  We've just got
	too much to cope with right now for me to throw these kind of
	resources at it, let alone myself.  I'll be in touch, Daniel.  And
	Reverend, if you can see your way clear to letting some more of your
	brethren get fitted for cyberverse access in the meantime, it'd be a
	big help.  Safe travels, gentlemen.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner solemnly shook hands with
	both men.  Gratitude for allies in a time of great trouble had
	perforce blunted his haughty habitual dislike for religious
	individuals.  Then he stumped out to his air car parked in the alley
	behind the building, where his faithful human pilot was waiting for
	him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The new nanobot
	neocortex was working perfectly.  In fact, it was exhilarating how
	well it worked.  Daniel could look at an object and just <I>know</I>
	how big it was, or how heavy, or what it was made of, or exactly how
	far away it was or how fast it was moving.  His hearing was
	similarly acute, able to identify the nature, location, and relative
	motion of objects just by the sounds they made.  And that was in
	real reality.   In any virtuality his reflexes were now so
	blindingly fast that he could react faster than all but the best
	simulations could cope with.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">For the first time, he had added a
	mesh interface to his kit.  Any information he wanted to look up, he
	could access just by thinking about it.  The clinic technician
	handed him a test page written in Old Kingdom Egyptian syllabic
	hieroglyphs, and he read it off the page at once.  On the next page
	he correctly matched complex chemical formulas to their molecular
	diagrams.  Story problems involving differential equations were
	obvious.  He was able to fill in blanks asking for obscure economic
	statistics, such as steel production in Japan in 1930, or Belgian
	unemployment in 1983, or the 2000 census population of Passaic, New
	Jersey.   Asked a question about the structure of Beethoven's Fifth
	Symphony, which he hadn't even heard in years, after perusing the
	musical score in his head for a moment it was apparent that the main
	theme of the second movement was, in fact, a major mode inversion of
	the motif from the first.   My, that was clever of crazy old Ludwig.
	 And Good Lord, Daniel didn't even know how to read musical
	notation!  Or at least, not until a few seconds ago.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">By the time he finished the
	manufacturer's standard set of test questions &ndash; achieving a
	perfect score &ndash; he was absolutely in awe of his new
	capabilities.  It was as if the entire sum of human knowledge was
	available to him.  His subsidiary ability to process and manipulate
	the data he accessed was similarly superhuman.  He felt like he
	could write a doctoral thesis in a completely unfamiliar field in a
	matter of minutes.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This... is... amazing!&rdquo;
	he got out, then suddenly felt almost ashamed at having uttered
	something so banal.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The clinician grinned back at him.
	 &ldquo;Isn't it sweet?&rdquo; he agreed.  &ldquo;Revision 11.3 just
	came out this month.  More than double the capability of 10.0, which
	was released just six months ago.  You got the hottest rig on the
	planet in your head right now, dude.  You can't be any smarter and
	still have a head,&rdquo; he joked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel laughed with him.  This was
	way cool.  Of course it was troubling, too, but what troubled him
	most now wasn't the intellectual abilities, it was that anybody
	could seriously consider such gifts to be evil in and of themselves.
	 That was like saying that being too well educated was bad.  </FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It reminded him
	of what he'd always heard about sex growing up, that it was such a
	powerful force, like an addictive drug that could make people do
	immoral and hurtful things just to get it.  But when he actually got
	there and experienced sexuality, he always found it joyous and
	pleasant, not guilty or demeaning.  It was certainly that way with
	Cylara.  God, she was hot!  They could do it for hours.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It seemed that, once again, he'd
	been lied to.   Everyone knew that if you got high-level Sing
	augmentations, you became a mindless zombie who couldn't pry
	themselves out of virtuality.  Yet now that he was here, mindless
	was absolutely the last thing that he knew himself to be.  He could
	even peruse any part of Scripture, or anything written by any
	Christian theologian or philosopher since, just by thinking about
	it.  Was that wicked?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So what exactly was he doing? 
	Roger Sarner was due here in a few minutes, to get his own
	augmentations done &ndash; incognito of course.   Today was May the
	8<SUP>th</SUP>, the day of their mutual appointment, and Daniel
	already knew how strictly Sarner kept his commitments.   If
	anything, he'd be early.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel had to admit to himself
	that he was tempted just to walk out now and leave old Sarner to his
	own devices.  For one thing, without access to Torch's money from
	Aurumnet, he'd have no way to pay for what he wanted done. 
	Imagining that scene was amusing.  But then, Daniel reflected, he'd
	probably just whistle up some of his goons and beat the shit out of
	the poor tech until he gave in and did it for free.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Maybe what he should do instead
	was spring for the best rig for Sarner as well.  Would it change him
	at all, make him see being a Sing in a different light?  Actually,
	you didn't have to be a genius to deduce that the probability of
	that was pretty near zero.  Men like Sarner &ndash; or his father
	for that matter &ndash; didn't just change their spots.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">On second thought, giving Sarner
	such a rig was impossible anyway.  What he himself had just received
	was an upgrade, albeit a substantial one.  But pure Moshes couldn't
	get a neocortex like his, not right away.  The installations had to
	be performed in stages.  And besides, all Sarner wanted was to be
	able to access the cyberverse and interface with others while there.
	  He hadn't even asked for any knowledge-base access or
	mind-expanding experiences.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So let him get what he wanted,
	then.   The question was, what did Daniel Cleary want?   He wasn't
	entirely sure anymore.   He knew that he didn't want to let down his
	dad, or the other people in the Order who were depending on him. 
	Above all, he knew he couldn't let the Lord down.  The heresies of
	the Sings had to be reigned in.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And yet, the more steeped he
	became in this so-called evil, the more he failed to find anything
	he could point to and say, &ldquo;Yes, that is evil.&rdquo;   It
	bothered him.  This supposed plot amongst the High Sings was the
	closest he could come, and even if it was all true it's not like
	they were the first people in history ever to plot against each
	other.  Was his father right in saying that the Devil's evil was so
	sweetly seductive that even as it ate you up, you couldn't see it
	for what it was?  Was that what was happening to him, now?  Or was
	he merely going on with this for his own selfish reasons, because
	dismantling the cyberverse was the only way he could have the woman
	he loved with him here in 3D?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The mobile nanoclinic's door chime
	sounded.  The technician switched on a view scanner over the door. 
	Yep, Sarner, right on time.  Looked like he was alone.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That the friend of your
	dad's?&rdquo; he asked Daniel.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel sighed.  &ldquo;Uh-huh,

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It's

	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You're welcome, though I
	can assure you that goodness has little to do with it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara fixed a measuring glance on
	the slight, lovely Japanese woman who had given her the datapad. 
	She was dressed demurely in a belted kimono of an almost antique
	style, her silky dark hair pinned back away from her face to brush
	her shoulders when she moved.  Her face was pale, classically pure,
	exquisitely molded, pretty almost like a doll was pretty.  Her eyes,
	though, were jet black and intense, and so full of will and thought
	that they were almost frightening, completely belying the tender
	sweetness of her features.  Something in their liquid depths,
	coupled with the way her mouth moved when she spoke, made Cylara
	think: <I>I would not want this woman angry at me.</I></FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Then you must want in
	return something that I can provide?&rdquo; she queried gently.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I want what you want.  To
	find out what your boyfriend is really up to.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara's heart sank.  In that case
	it stood to reason that he must be up to something.  She had hoped
	her suspicions were unfounded, but if this formidable woman thought
	there was something worth learning about Torch, then it was quite
	likely that there was &ndash; and that she wasn't going to like it
	at all when she finally learned the truth.  She steeled her resolve.
	 She had to know.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The two women stood facing each
	other on a beach, just above the reach of the fingers of water that
	fluttered up the sand as the shallow surf rolled lazily ashore.  It
	was a warm late afternoon, nearing sunset.  Although there were some
	dwellings visible on the bluffs up above the beach, there was no one
	else in sight.  Her moment of disappointment past, Cylara decided to
	focus on practical matters.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So will this pad display
	everywhere Torch goes?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A slight head shake, rustling her
	hair.  &ldquo;No.  That isn't possible.  When you brought him
	yesterday to the world I asked you to, his keyprint and neocortex
	client profile were recorded.  Those identify him uniquely.   His
	identifiers have been uploaded to a number of servers hosting a
	large number of virtualities.  Any time he enters one of them, a log
	entry will be created and sent to the pad.  But any world he enters
	that isn't watching for him won't record anything.  And of course
	the system cannot track his movements in meatspace.  The pad also
	contains a list of the participating virtualities which will
	generate log entries.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Experimentally Cylara navigated to
	that list, discovering tens of thousands listed.  &ldquo;How did you
	get so many worlds to cooperate?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Her benefactor shrugged.  &ldquo;Many
	hosting companies make treaties with each other under which they
	agree to share data on mutual visitors.  This is done, for example,
	in cases of suspected fraud or other criminal activities which may
	cause economic harm to the operators or their legitimate customers.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara's heart sank a little
	further.  &ldquo;You think he's involved in something criminal,
	then.&rdquo;  Perhaps this woman was a private investigator or
	something.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Probably not in the
	conventional sense.  Despite the length of the list, only a small
	percentage of popular virtualities are represented on it.  Don't
	expect a continuous stream of hits.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Right.  Will it be possible
	to track his movements within a particular instance?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes, but only if you are
	zoned into the identical instance yourself, carrying the pad.  It
	will then work something like crude radar, letting you home in on
	him.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara looked at the woman
	appraisingly.  She gestured at the datapad.  &ldquo;Who do you have
	to be to get one of these, normally?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Typically, a sysadmin from
	a hosting company.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But that isn't you, is it?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A brief smile.  &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You're someone
	significantly more important, aren't you?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A flash of something that looked
	like genuine amusement suffused her placid face, as if for a moment
	the ice had melted into a glow of almost sisterly affection.  
	&ldquo;Importance is a relative quality.  You may think so if you
	wish.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Encouraged, Cylara pressed on.  &ldquo;I
	think you're a non-biological Sing.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The woman bowed ever so slightly. 
	&ldquo;That is so.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Can you at least tell me
	your name?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It is Riksana.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana.  Very lovely. 
	Will we meet again?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I hope so.  When your
	pursuit has achieved results, please send to me with this.&rdquo; 
	Riksana handed over a small coin-like disc, whitish silver as if it
	were platinum.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Thank you, I will.&rdquo; 
	Cylara bowed formally, respectfully, in her best approximation of
	the Japanese style.   Riksana responded, not quite so deeply, in the
	proper manner for one acknowledging the gratitude of another.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I must go now,&rdquo;
	Riksana said quietly.  &ldquo;Until we meet again, Cylara Janovic.&rdquo;
	 She did not zone out, she simply faded from view as if she had
	become insubstantial, or had turned her attention elsewhere.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara pocketed the disc and the
	pad and strolled pensively down the beach.   Why did something like
	this have to happen with all of her promising relationships?   And
	why did she want to find out the truth so badly?  Just so she could
	feel angry and disappointed?  Was she that eager to find an excuse
	to break up with Torch, or was she, just maybe, hoping desperately
	to discover some deeper reason why she shouldn't?  What Riksana
	obliquely intimated about criminal behavior was far from
	encouraging.  But then why should Riksana help <I>her</I> instead of
	some hired detective?   Was it because of something special about
	Torch, or about herself?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She only knew that she felt
	melancholy about the way things were developing, yet couldn't turn
	back from it.  It seemed that the sun was setting on her latest love
	affair, just as it had on all of her previous ones.  Listening to
	the gentle surf, she wandered down the beach watching the
	simulation's sun make its slow, steady dive for the horizon.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They burst out into what appeared
	to be a concrete drainage trench, flooded only with late afternoon
	daylight.  Torch got his map bearings quickly.  &ldquo;This way!&rdquo;
	he shouted, and took off running up the slanting far side of the
	trench.  The others sprinted after him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They emerged into the edge of a
	parking lot for cars of both the air and ground varieties.  On the
	far side of it was a low building, with a taller tower bulking
	behind it, less than two city blocks away.  That was where they had
	to go.  Torch started a dash along the edge of the lot, giving up
	the direct route in favor of avoiding the people getting in or out
	of vehicles.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They reached the far side of the
	lot, and charged across a street and down a broad sidewalk.  At that
	moment, a pursuing air vehicle, which looked like some kind of
	modified chopper, banked around a building, following the canyon
	through the city streets at an alarmingly low altitude.  It swerved
	toward them, reared back to take off speed.  They could feel its
	wind beating down on them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Halt!&rdquo; an amplified
	voice roared down over the craft's mechanized howl.  In response,
	Torch flitted across the street and around the next corner, sticking
	close to some pedestrians, who had stopped in their tracks to watch
	open-mouthed at the eight fleeing men and the hovering chopper.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The chopper pilot kicked the craft
	into forward motion again, banked wide around the same corner. 
	Single gunshots were fired from the flying vehicle, spraying shards
	of brick and sidewalk around them as they ran.  Bystanders all along
	the street were ducking into doorways, or just hitting the deck. 
	Torch could now see their destination at the end of the block. 
	&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he exhorted, and Sarner and the others put on
	a matching burst of speed.  One man cried out as a bullet pierced
	his hip.  He stumbled and rolled to a stop.  Torch looked back over
	his shoulder, but did not slacken his desperate pace.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As they sped across the final
	street toward the glass doors of their destination, one of the men
	twisted round and presented his rifle to return fire at the chopper.
	 His shots either missed or spanged off the vehicle's armor plating.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Abruptly they were inside a busy
	lobby, where heads were turning at the sound of choppers and gunfire
	leaking in through the opened doors.   Torch located the exit zone
	point, opposite a bank of elevators, and sprinted toward it, a
	cryptokey already spinning between his fingers.  Sarner's men
	shouldered two other patrons out of the way as Torch fitted his key
	into a matching socket.  The scan system lit up green.  &ldquo;Grab
	the zone bar!&rdquo; he commanded, and the others stepped up next to
	him to do so, grasping a long silvery railing under the panel.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Just as Torch was reaching for the
	ZONE button, the console went dark.  Security men streamed out of
	one of the elevators across the lobby.  More came in from the
	street, probably those who had been chasing them from the records
	library.  Other patrons scattered to get out of the way as Sarner's
	men brandished guns.  Someone screamed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Erisian security forces! 
	Freeze!&rdquo; an officer shouted.   A dozen weapons were brought to
	bear as the security detail spread out.  &ldquo;You're under arrest!
	 Put down your weapons!  Now!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner sneered.  &ldquo;You're not
	even real, you asshole,&rdquo; he scoffed.  &ldquo;Disengage
	interface,&rdquo; he ordered, to the others.  Torch shook his head
	in disgust, but complied.  The world of Erisia faded out into a
	burst of grey static.</FONT><P ALIGN=CENTER>

	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel shambled
	into the clubhouse common room, truculent and ready for the
	inevitable argument.  Sarner was there before him, drawing himself a
	cup of coffee, as were several others.   They and their cyberverse
	invasion force had commandeered one of the charity housing projects
	the NAF had built recently in the northwest, displacing the
	free-riding residents at gunpoint.  Over two hundred of their troops
	were now quartered here, where they could jack into the cyberverse
	at will.  Daniel slid irritably into a chair at the big rectangular
	table, on the side opposite Sarner.  Roger stirred creamer into his
	mug and sat down, looking at Daniel critically.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That, Cleary, was an
	unmitigated disaster.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Even on short acquaintance, Daniel
	was expecting this accusation, and decided to take a different tack
	right away by agreeing with it.  &ldquo;Yes, indeed it was.  And I'm
	afraid it's your attitude which made it one.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner looked at him sharply. 
	&ldquo;Oh, really?  And how do you figure that?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You must have been snoozing
	during the pre-mission briefing.  You should have heard that Erisia
	is one of the first whole-Earth type cyberverse worlds, created
	twelve years ago.  It's an old world that still retains several
	million consistent Sing inhabitants.  But it's also a complete
	world, both in terms of its physical space and its overall
	population, which is nearly half a billion.  The founders' idea was
	to create a world similar to Earth, but without the defects inherent
	to Earth society.  No war, no poverty, no pollution, no
	overpopulation, and with change occurring at a more bearable pace.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was also made clear that
	the minority human inhabitants constituted an aristocracy that could
	do whatever they pleased, and that the vast bulk of the population
	were AIs who existed to serve the Sings who zoned in to live there.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Exactly.  Which they can
	only do by maintaining order whenever disruptive visitors zone in
	and cause trouble.  Mr. Sarner, on the advice of our informants, we
	went to the central records library in the capital city of Kalliste.
	 Our aim was to obtain copies of records which had been lodged there
	at or near the time of the founding of Erisia, particularly if the
	documents could be associated with Justin Turrell or any of a list
	of people close to him.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner nodded.  &ldquo;Where the
	staff there were not at all inclined to be helpful, despite what we
	were promised, as you might have noticed.  And, by the way, your
	kissing their asses undermined what I, and my trained investigative
	specialists, were trying to achieve by asserting our authority.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel shook his head.  &ldquo;On
	the contrary, your needless escalation only served to tip off the
	controlling AI that we constituted a disruptive element.  One of
	your so-called specialists pulled a gun on a librarian.  That
	naturally triggered a security response.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That was only after the
	librarian had already flat-out declined to give us what we wanted,
	in case you weren't paying attention.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Actually, the librarian
	said that some of the records were access-restricted, and hinted
	that we might need to obtain passwords from their custodians &ndash;
	which logically could only mean Erisian PCs.  Our next step was
	obviously to inquire how we could contact those custodians and set
	up an interview.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We are not on a scavenger
	hunt!&rdquo; Sarner said with evident annoyance.  &ldquo;What was
	obvious was that the AI librarian could have allowed us access, and
	was just giving us the runaround with that
	get-the-passwords-from-my-boss routine.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No, he couldn't.  Not if he
	was programmed not to.  The thing you have to learn, Mr. Sarner, is
	that cyberverse worlds usually have their own internal logic, and it
	all works for the benefit of the users, or residents, of that world.
	 That doesn't necessarily include random visitors.  Do you honestly
	think that a world as old as Erisia has never experienced hoodlums
	zoning into it?  When we threatened gratuitous violence, any AI in
	that world, humble librarian or otherwise, would be capable of
	recognizing that we were <I>not</I> the sort of people you want to
	go around introducing to the boss PC aristocrats.  On the contrary.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Then, Cleary, I want you to
	find out who those bosses are in real life, and we'll have a little
	face-to-face chat right here about their access passwords.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel sighed.  &ldquo;That may
	not be possible now, at least not for us.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What do you mean?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Even assuming we could
	track a PC Sing back to their jack &ndash; which is practically
	impossible ever since your people blew up Ferret by mistake &ndash;
	anybody using our key fingerprints is simply <I>not</I> going to get
	into Erisia again.  Not without raising an immediate alarm.  We
	might as well zone right into a jail cell.  In fact I'd be very
	surprised if <I>anybody</I> who showed up in that library asking for
	the same information didn't get pretty much that response for a
	while to come.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner considered.  &ldquo;So what
	you're telling me is, we can't try again in that world, for now.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What I'm telling you is
	that we're screwed if the information we need is actually stored
	there.  And that we'll get the same kinds of bad results elsewhere
	if you, and your people, don't figure out that you're not in the
	real world, and you can't just bust heads to get what you want, just
	because somebody &ndash; whether a PC or a NPC &ndash; gives you a
	hard way to go.  We have to work within the system, whatever that
	system happens to be.   It's an infiltration, not an invasion, Mr.
	Sarner.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Could be something to what
	you say, Cleary,&rdquo; Sarner admitted reluctantly.  &ldquo;But our
	Full Sing informants have given us more than a dozen virtualities to
	look in, and we just don't have the time for patient diplomacy. 
	Establishing contacts, building relationships, fabricating
	identities, winning people's trust.  Our special agents know that
	whole routine, believe me.  But that stuff takes months, or even
	years.  No time for all that.  We have to shake something loose
	quick, or this is all going to be wasted effort.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel brushed off this concern. 
	&ldquo;There are hundreds of thousands of virtualities out there, of
	all sizes.  Millions if you count the micro special-purpose ones. 
	By narrowing it down to a dozen, it's manageable.  We have enough
	people to insert teams into all of the candidate virtualities at
	once.  I've visited hundreds of virtualities in my time.  So have
	some of the others.  We can do it efficiently if we just keep our
	heads and ask the right questions.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Roger shrugged.  &ldquo;Then maybe
	I'll let you lead the team next time.  I gotta admit it creeps me
	out some, being in a whole other world.  It's been four days since I
	got these damn nanites in my head, and that's already too long.  I
	don't understand what's wrong with people that they can't just stay
	here and work on this world.   What the hell do we need Erisia for
	anyway, when things are going to hell here where it counts because
	of all the folks who'd rather live <I>there?</I>   Makes me sick.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well if we're going to fix
	it, we need to blend in better.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We also need more money. 
	These access charges are racking up quite a bill.  Everything costs.
	 Everywhere you zone, everything you do and everything you use, they
	freaking charge for.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel smiled indulgently. 
	&ldquo;Actually the microfees are tiny.  We're just running up bills
	for almost two hundred people is all.  A few pounds of gold would
	fund the whole operation for a while.  Doesn't the Federation have
	any gold anywhere?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner nodded vigorously.  &ldquo;We
	sure do.  Turned up a couple whole bars of it at the central bank. 
	They had 'em saved there as museum pieces, leftover from when they
	sold all the gold, or leased it out and never got it back &ndash;
	their damned records are pretty unclear about just what really
	happened to it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well there you go, then. 
	That's huge.  Just bail the bars into Aurumnet.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner looked piqued.  &ldquo;Cleary,
	we contacted them, but they wouldn't even send us out an examiner. 
	The pricks said the gold was stolen, and they couldn't take receipt
	of stolen goods.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Did you tell them the gold
	came from the Federation?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Of course,&rdquo; Sarner
	said indignantly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel found himself torn between
	wanting to laugh and wanting to slap the Secretary upside the head. 
	&ldquo;Well that's <I>why</I> they considered it stolen,&rdquo; he
	explained.  Sarner looked confused.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But if the gold belongs to
	the government&ndash;&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Mr. Sarner, don't you
	realize that to free market folks, anything which belongs to
	government, at least that far back, must be the result of either
	seizure or taxation, which they consider a form of theft?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Taxes aren't theft!&rdquo;
	he began hotly, flushing red with irritation.  &ldquo;That's&ndash;&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Would you like to try
	convincing Aurumnet of that?  It's an AI, you know.  Want to argue
	with a computer?  Look, just transfer the bars to some private
	individuals and have them bail them in as their own, then distribute
	the digital coins around to the whole team.  No problem.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner stared at him balefully. 
	&ldquo;I don't want anybody so rich that they get any ideas about
	staying in there, living it up.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Fine.  Whatever.  Let's
	just get it done so we can do our jobs.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Everyone doing their duty made
	sense to Roger Sarner, so he had to nod.  &ldquo;I've got to get
	back to Command HQ,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;The next mission is
	scheduled for 20:00 hours, to that city on Truferia, what was its
	name?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Eden.  I'll lead the team
	in, if you like,&rdquo; Daniel volunteered, grateful that Sarner
	would be absenting himself.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Do it,&rdquo; Sarner said
	as he rose from the table and stalked out of the village clubhouse.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel Cleary glanced at the wall
	clock.  Not quite 17:30.   He had time to snag some food, go say hi
	to Cylara to stoke up his motivation, and maybe even catch a brief
	nap.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Erisia had looked promising.  But
	now he hoped the List wasn't located there, or they might be a long
	time getting it.  It seemed these damned Feds only knew how to bark
	orders and break heads.  No subtlety.  His dad had warned him about
	that, and as usual when it came to judgments about people, his old
	man was basically right.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Someday somebody might have to do
	Secretary Sarner like he himself, rumor had it, had done the
	President.  Daniel sure as hell wasn't eager to watch helplessly
	while he screwed up any more List missions.  Better to lead the men
	himself.  The Lord worked in mysterious ways.  Maybe He meant for
	Daniel to be His instrument.</FONT></DIV>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">His escorts
	didn't seem to be in a hurry.  Robert Reynolds was flanked by two
	Homeland Security guards as he paced down an interior hallway of an
	old hotel convention complex on the way to his meeting with Justin. 
	Ostensibly present for his protection, the two bodyguards were
	really there to keep him from escaping or having any unauthorized
	contacts with anyone.  Both men were young, poorly educated, and
	from a religious background.  One wore a KOJ pin on his lapel. 
	There was an increasing amount of that sort of thing going around. 
	Plenty of Federation employees were getting religion these days. 
	Originally, Roger Sarner had recruited the KOJ to supplement his
	forces, but Reynolds was beginning to wonder whether in truth
	Cleary's KOJ hadn't recruited the Federation instead.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was actually rather a long walk
	across this old Helena hotel to get from the senator's suite to the
	conference center.  This hallway was lit by old-fashioned lighting
	coils in sconces, bright enough to illuminate their way but dim
	enough to conceal most of the stains and tatters in the ancient
	carpeting, which was short pile and boasted a dazzling, if faded,
	floral pattern.  The long corridor stretched past dozens of doors
	leading into empty, dusty rooms that had not been used in years. 
	Fortunately, the suites the Federation party were actually using had
	been invaded by robotic cleaners last night before they'd arrived,
	making them at least habitable.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">One of Reynolds' handlers stumbled
	on something, turned toward his partner with a startled gasp, and
	half-toppled, half-crumpled onto the floor.  From the way his eyes
	were rolling up into his head, he hadn't merely tripped on the
	frayed carpet.   The other guard exchanged startled looks with
	Reynolds as both of them knelt down to see what was the matter. 
	Abruptly the second man hissed out his breath in a sighing groan and
	rolled sideways to land supine on his back.  Both men seemed to be
	unconscious now.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds braced his hands on his
	thighs and surged back to his feet, looking up and down the hallway.
	 Now he saw them: two figures who had been creeping along behind
	them.  One of them was putting something away into his pocket.  A
	weapon?  Who were these people, Cyberantes assassins?   One of them,
	the smaller of the two, was masked.  Both were wearing dark
	clothing.  They began to walk forward calmly.  Reynolds was quite
	sure they did not mean to attack him too, or the deed would already
	be done.  In view of this he elected to remain silent rather than
	yelling for help; help being a relative term in any event.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">To his considerable surprise,
	Reynolds suddenly recognized that the unmasked man walking toward
	him was Justin Turrell.  The senator stumbled forward a couple of
	steps.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What are you doing here,
	instead of in the conference room?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Springing you of course, my
	friend,&rdquo; Justin replied conversationally as he offered the
	senator his hand.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds shook it with a smile. 
	&ldquo;Much appreciated.  But what about the conference?  Sarner and
	his bunch are up there expecting us.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Oh, the meeting will go
	forward, never fear.  It wouldn't do to disappoint his grand
	secretary-ship.&rdquo;  Justin unclipped another device from his
	belt, held it out, and waved it over each of the fallen guards. 
	Then he aimed it at Reynolds, who could not feel any effects.  It
	must be a passive scanner of some kind.  Justin nodded to his
	shorter companion in the mask, the shape of whose body suggested a
	petite female.  That individual silently produced a box-like object
	with a tiny holoscreen on one side and a small cone projecting from
	the side opposite.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A fog-like vapor streamed from the
	cone-shaped emitter, almost like an old smoke machine.  As it grew
	denser, threatening to fill the wide hall, it coalesced into three
	tall oval forms.  In a matter of seconds, these took on humanoid
	shapes.  As Senator Reynolds watched with open-mouthed amazement,
	the three vague bodies took on detail, color, depth, and solidity,
	as if absorbing them right out of the air.  And suddenly there stood
	himself, along with his two minders.  The faux Reynolds smiled
	warmly at the original, and flipped Justin the suggestion of a
	jaunty salute.  Then the doppelganger set off down the hall, his
	guards falling into step behind.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds gaped at Justin as the
	latter calmly opened a nearby room door.  &ldquo;Help me drag these
	two out of sight,&rdquo; he requested.  After only a moment's
	hesitation, the senator bent down and assisted.  They deposited the
	pair onto the dust-laden bedspread covering the single large king
	size bed and returned to the hall.  The room smelled even more stale
	and musty than did the hallway outside.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They'll be out for hours,&rdquo;
	Justin explained as he closed the door behind them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What are those things?&rdquo;
	Reynolds asked, jerking his thumb up the passage where the trio of
	duplicates could no longer be seen.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Foglet bodies, made of
	billions of interlocking nanites.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And controlled by an AI?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Oh yes.  They can walk and
	talk and play your part to perfection, well enough to fool Sarner at
	any rate.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds nodded as he fell into
	step beside Justin, who began walking at a brisk pace in the
	opposite direction down the hall.   Justin's nameless female
	companion sprinted ahead as if to scout.  &ldquo;I expect you have
	another foglet body arriving to play your part?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes, though it's not
	actually made of foglets, but real cells fabricated in a MM unit,
	just like this body.  I'm expecting them to give it rather more
	scrutiny than a foglet facsimile might be able to withstand.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Right.  But then who's
	controlling that body, if you're here?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin chuckled.  &ldquo;My Paia. 
	She was the logical choice, since she knows me so well.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds grinned, suddenly feeling
	at least ten years younger and less tired, ready to take on the
	world.  They entered a stairwell, spiraled down a bunch of floors. 
	&ldquo;The parking garage exit will be guarded,&rdquo; the senator
	remarked.  &ldquo;We came in that way.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I know.  We have a
	foolproof way out, though.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Glad to hear it.&rdquo; 
	They arrived at the garage level and found their scout standing in
	the doorway holding open the stairwell door.  She beckoned
	wordlessly and they followed her along the back edge of the garage,
	toward a dark corner.  The lighting was spotty here due to most of
	the bulbs being dead or broken, and only weak daylight made it back
	this far from the entrance.  Bits of trash lay in the corners,
	eddied there by the strong winds of winter seasons past.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Suddenly Justin's companion was
	opening a door in midair, which obviously led into a vehicle.  An
	invisible vehicle.  All three of them boarded and softly swung the
	door closed behind them, Justin taking the driver's chair.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">An invisible ground car?&rdquo;
	Reynolds said incredulously.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes,&rdquo; Justin replied.
	  &ldquo;We copied some technology that was developed by the
	Cyberantes for their body armor.  It's not only invisible to radar,
	it's transparent in the visual and infrared spectrums as well.  I'm
	going to rig silent running and try to slip out unnoticed by the
	guard at the entrance.  Might not work, but even if he notices us at
	least he won't know what it was.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">How did you get this in
	here, then?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin grinned.  &ldquo;Parked it
	here three days ago.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Right after we agreed on
	the meeting location,&rdquo; Reynolds said, nodding in
	comprehension.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Exactly.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They were sliding forward now,
	turning to face the bright squares of daylight at the far side of
	the building.  As they drew close to the egress from the garage,
	they could see a single security man sitting in the old gatehouse,
	where once upon a time attendants had collected tickets and parking
	fees from patrons.   His feet were propped up and he looked like he
	might be snoozing.   The mechanical gate bars were up, and in fact
	were broken off short, sticking up like fingers accusing hotel
	maintenance of permanent dereliction of duty.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin drove out through the lane
	farthest from the guard's booth, but something must have made a
	queer noise because the guard stirred, set his feet down, and
	stepped out of the booth to look around.  His puzzled expression
	proved that he could not see them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">When they were about a block away,
	Justin switched over to an air travel mode, and the stealthed
	vehicle launched itself skyward and zoomed away.  Reynolds found his
	spirits rising with the aircar.  He had hardly dared to hope that he
	would ever be free again.  Free to take action against the usurpers
	of the Federation.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So where are we going?&rdquo;
	he asked, presuming that Justin would have some specific destination
	in mind.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">To a secure house in the
	mountains above Boulder, Colorado.  You'll be safe there, and have
	access to untraceable communications.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Excellent.  I can't thank
	you enough for this.  But I will pay you back, never you fear,&rdquo;
	Reynolds said grimly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin shot him a sharp but
	somewhat bemused look.  &ldquo;Actually, I wasn't hoping for any
	particular payback.  I just thought it would be a good idea to get
	you out of there.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well whatever your motives,
	I'm grateful.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That idiot Robert
	Reynolds would undoubtedly have given away the store, had he not
	been negotiating in full knowledge of the fact that he, Roger
	Sarner, was present behind the one-way glass, listening in and
	accompanied by a full security squad.  From inside the meeting room,
	the trick panel looked indistinguishable from an ordinary wall
	section.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This Justin character was slick,
	and all business.  No wasted words.  Sarner could almost admire that
	quality about him.  He wanted the Federation to issue a declaration
	affirming the right of all citizens to enter and inhabit the
	cyberverse without hindrance.  In return, he would persuade the
	Cyberantes to stop interfering with Federation personnel.  Which was
	a non-starter and no accord at all, as far as Roger was concerned. 
	Reynolds of course, being spineless as usual, would have had no
	difficulty giving Justin what he wanted.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner turned to his lead
	technician.  &ldquo;You got a fix on him yet?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The tech nodded.  &ldquo;Yes, sir.
	 We have the brain wave harmonics recorded.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Outstanding.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The body of the man in the room
	was of course being run by the computerized Justin, like a puppet on
	a string.  When that happened, the nanobots in its neocortex
	stimulated the brain's neurons so that the brain waves took on a
	particular pattern, like a sympathetic vibration.  The higher
	harmonics of that pattern constituted an unique energy fingerprint. 
	In theory, they could now scan for that fingerprint in meatspace, or
	in any virtuality into which Justin projected.  It would show up
	anywhere that he was controlling a body.  Which meant that they
	could now track him wherever he went, so long as they had someone in
	the same world with the necessary equipment.  Portable equipment,
	that they were even now mass-producing.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Somewhere, Sarner knew, there must
	exist a world which this Justin Turrell entity called home.  The
	Master Node List might very well be stored there, where he lived. 
	Even if it wasn't, odds were good that Justin must occasionally
	visit the place where it was kept.  Tracking Mr. Turrell around the
	cyberverse was now going to be Job One for young Cleary and the top
	cyberverse invasion teams.  He even meant to take a hand himself,
	when he could.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Abruptly, Reynolds and Turrell
	were standing up, shaking hands over the table.  The meeting was
	over.  Sarner figured Justin had to be expecting that he would be
	prevented from leaving, or else that his synthetic flesh would be
	tailed when he did.  But they were going to surprise him and do
	neither of those things, since they already had what they needed. 
	Let him think they were dealing honestly.   This Sing was supposed
	to be a mastermind, so any advantage could be crucial.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The two security men reappeared to
	escort Senator Reynolds back to his suite.  Sarner had been half
	expecting the Cyberantes to show up and hit the place in an effort
	to liberate the senator.  But obviously that had been a needless
	concern.  The studied deviousness of their enemies had him jumping
	at shadows lately.  What use, after all, would a dumbass
	glad-handing politician be to a bunch of rebel anarchists?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The house
	overlooking Boulder was old and big, but well-built and plainly
	fully modernized.  It sprawled at the edge of a steep slope running
	down toward the nearby city and commanding a wide view out into the
	flat, hazy distance of the plains.  The three of them stood in the
	large living room, looking out the huge picture windows facing east.
	 Reynolds was again moved to express his relief at being rescued.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I want to thank you again,
	both of you, for getting me out,&rdquo; he said, in his most sincere
	tone.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin smiled.  &ldquo;I've freed
	you from Secretary Sarner's clutches, but I'm afraid it's beyond my
	power to free you from the prison in which you've locked yourself.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I don't understand,&rdquo;
	Reynolds said, genuinely puzzled.  Justin could sometimes get like
	this, but he usually explained himself.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I mean that you seem to
	think that you can't live for yourself, that you have to serve
	others instead, almost as if you have no life of your own.  And that
	you can fulfill this service only by controlling the use of force. 
	You're quite mistaken on both counts, but I know I cannot persuade
	you of this.  Happily, I've brought you someone who can.&rdquo;  And
	he looked at his lady companion, who was still masked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Senator Reynolds turned toward
	her.  So far she had scarcely spoken, and then only in a low,
	muffled tone to acknowledge his thanks.  He was suddenly curious to
	know who she might be.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Almost casually, she removed her
	cap and face mask.  Reynolds was so stricken by her revealed visage
	that he stumbled and nearly fell, so that she had to reach out to
	steady him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Marguerite! &ndash;&rdquo;
	he gasped out.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Rob,&rdquo; she said
	clearly, and the voice was suddenly exactly as he remembered it.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds looked wildly at Justin. 
	&ldquo;You didn't...&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Oh yes I did, my friend.  
	You need help I cannot provide.  You have decisions to make.  And
	things you cannot do without help.  Her help.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds stared into his wife's
	face, and tears started in his eyes.  She moved close to him and put
	her arms around his neck, looking up at him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I hear you've been a lonely
	workaholic these past ten years,&rdquo; she said gently.  &ldquo;Always
	out selflessly giving of yourself to others.  I suppose I shouldn't
	be too surprised.  But don't you realize I would have wanted you to
	be happy?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He breathed stertorously, his
	hands trembling at his sides.  Several times they started up as if
	to return Marguerite's embrace, but fell back.  It was as if he
	realized that that gesture of recognition and acceptance would be
	irrevocable.  &ldquo;I wanted... to give something back...&rdquo; he
	stammered.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She looked saddened.  &ldquo;Did
	you think you needed to do penance because we used to be happy
	together?  That's so like you, Robert.  But penance time is over. 
	I'm back now, and we're going to be happy again.&rdquo;  She tilted
	her face up and leaned forward to kiss him lightly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I...&rdquo;  He faltered
	and had to start again.  &ldquo;I can't believe... it's you.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She looked mock indignant now. 
	&ldquo;Justin warned me you would react this way.  Well I can assure
	you that I'm as me as you've ever known me.   And I'm not letting
	you off the hook, either.  I need you as much as you need me. 
	That's why I insisted that Justin let me help rescue you.  I love
	you, Rob.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Was this his wife, or was she not?
	 That question, which had paralyzed him since she uncovered her
	face, suddenly seemed not to matter.   This person was alive, and
	she wanted and needed him.  So whether the soul was the same or not,
	how could he not return her love?  With a groan he enfolded her in
	his arms and buried his face in her hair.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin stood nearby, beaming
	benignly.  When the reunited couple at last pulled apart, he spoke. 
	&ldquo;I think I should let you two go on getting reacquainted. 
	Senator, you'll find an excellent communications terminal in the
	office down the upstairs hall.  You know how to get in touch with
	me.   Marguerite, it was a pleasure and thank you so much for your
	help.  I look forward to seeing you both again soon.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They nodded and murmured something
	polite, still looking a bit dazzled by one another.  Justin turned
	and walked quietly out the front door toward his waiting aircar.</FONT></DIV>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The office park
	actually looked like a park, which happened to have an office
	complex in the middle of it.  There were acres of lawns and flower
	gardens, potted shrubs in urns surrounding the intersections of
	paved lanes and sidewalks, and everything was green and white with
	colorful accents of many hues under a brilliant high sun.  The
	office structure was huge and sprawling, with an eccentric, angular
	design and numerous wings branching off from the central mass, like
	the limbs on a starfish.  It was all made of glass and some kind of
	alabaster stone, off-white like noble metal.  Birds wheeled and
	whistled in darting flocks above the grounds.  Although there was
	wide visibility across the park (none of the plantings were tall) no
	one else could be descried out walking around at the moment.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Roger Sarner and Torch stood at
	the entry zone point, looking around getting their bearings. 
	Neither had any idea where they had just appeared.  They were here
	only because one of their agents had reported detecting Justin's
	electronic psycho-signature in this virtuality.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Only yesterday, Justin had met in
	the flesh with Senator Robert Reynolds.  And some hours later,
	Reynolds had been discovered missing, with his guards drugged
	senseless in a hotel room.  Sarner was willing to bet that Justin
	had had something to do with that, though they still had no clue how
	he might have managed it.   So when this intelligence on Justin's
	current whereabouts was received, the Homeland Security Secretary
	and <I>de facto</I> leader of the North American Federation had once
	again decided that he needed to put aside his work on big picture
	management, and concentrate on tracking Justin to his lair &ndash;
	this time with but a single helper.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They stood in a four-way
	intersection of walkways, surrounded by stone benches and urns in a
	Grecian style.  Torch chose a path that ran toward what appeared to
	be an entrance to the complex, and began walking that way.  Sarner
	fell into step beside him.  As they drew closer, the rows of large,
	dark windows, opaqued by the outdoor brightness, seemed to stare
	down at them.  Torch glanced up quickly at the sun.  For some
	reason, the principal light source in this virtuality was a bit
	richer and darker than that of Earth's sun, tinted more golden than
	white.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A large stone logo mounted on a
	granite plinth came into view, planted alongside the path near the
	ornate entrance which they were now approaching.  It resembled a
	starburst, like a compass rose with many arrows of different sizes. 
	Within its center circle gleamed two characters that looked wrought
	of solid gold, written in a simple, blocky font like that of an
	ancient computer display: <FONT FACE="Impact">4F</FONT>.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch stopped for a second as the
	meaning struck him, then resumed walking.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What is it?&rdquo; Sarner
	asked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It just hit me.  This must
	be the headquarters of Aurumnet.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Oh?  How can you tell?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That emblem.  A golden 4F. 
	The number 4F is the hexadecimal equivalent of 79, the atomic number
	for gold.  I've seen that logo countless times before, usually in
	shops, who display it to indicate that they accept Aurumnet
	coinage.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I see,&rdquo; said Sarner
	after a moment.  &ldquo;So why would Justin be visiting the
	corporate headquarters?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I don't know.  Maybe he's
	on the board of directors or something.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner grunted.  That wouldn't
	surprise him.  The way he'd heard it, this Aurumnet was widely used
	to support global mesh networking, via the DR.OS protocols.   And
	evidently Justin gave away the original DR.OS code for nothing by
	publishing it as open source, so it made sense he had to be making
	his money somewhere else.  It was clever, really.  Get everybody to
	use your free software, then take a stake in the payment company
	everybody used to settle their access fees with one another.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Which still didn't explain what
	this place might have to do with the Master Node List, of course.  A
	corporate headquarters office with lots of people working in it
	probably wouldn't make a very good hiding spot for that.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch and Sarner reached the big
	glass doors.  Torch yanked on the metal hoop handle and the door
	swung smoothly open.   Inside was a vast atrium with a reception
	counter at the far end.  They paced across the glossy marble floor
	toward a man in a dark blue business suit who seemed to be the sole
	occupant behind the reception counter.   Sarner guessed he was
	probably an AI, not a human at all.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Welcome to Aurumnet,&rdquo;
	the attendant greeted them cheerfully as they arrived at his
	counter.   &ldquo;Visitor identification badges must be worn while
	on the premises.  May I ask your names and purpose of visit?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Given his much greater experience
	in dealing with cyberverse AIs, it was agreed that Torch would do
	most of the talking.  &ldquo;This is Mr. Sarner; I am Mr. Torch,&rdquo;
	he said now.   &ldquo;We're just here to tour the facility.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Roger thought that sounded lame,
	but somewhat to his surprise, the being simply handed them each a
	badge with their name on it, and gave Torch a portable holo-display
	which was evidently a map and interactive tour guide.  &ldquo;Please
	enjoy your visit to our headquarters facility.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As they walked away toward one of
	the wide hallways leading out of the atrium, Sarner leaned close to
	Torch and whispered: &ldquo;Their security seems a bit lax, don't
	you think?  They didn't search us, or even ID us.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch tapped the badge now pinned
	on his chest.  &ldquo;Not really.  They probably scanned and ID'd us
	the moment we zoned in.  And we <I>are</I> being monitored.  I
	expect they're being unobtrusive rather than lax.&rdquo;  Torch
	pulled their brain wave scanning device out of his pocket, held it
	in one hand while studying the activated tour guide display in the
	other.  It located Justin's electromagnetic spoor about halfway down
	the wing they were now entering.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Roger couldn't help feeling a few
	pangs of jealousy at the magnificence of this office complex.  It
	was bigger and grander than any airport concourse or convention
	center that he'd ever seen.  Although knowing it was all virtual
	geometry, and that therefore none of it really existed, certainly
	helped.  The architecture was magnificent, the decor and furnishings
	spare but elegant.  The carpet designs were like dim holograms which
	seemed to change subtly beneath their feet as they walked over them,
	almost as if their shadows or reflections were somehow being cast in
	the carpet fibers.  Strangely, there were few other people moving
	about in the wide corridors.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch slowed as they neared
	Justin's apparent location, which was through a closed door on their
	right not far ahead.  Abruptly he turned and darted behind a pillar
	as that door opened.  Sarner instantly imitated his motion, and
	peered with him around the pillar.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A slight man with sandy blond hair
	and light eyes emerged, and began walking briskly away from them
	down the hall.  Sarner nodded to Torch.  This was indeed the same
	man he had seen yesterday through the false wall during the meeting
	with Reynolds.  Torch had also seen him once before, and vividly
	remembered where: in Stefan's entourage, at a Cyberantes meeting.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What's that room he's
	coming out of?&rdquo; Sarner hissed softly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch consulted their holo-map.
	&ldquo;It's marked safe deposit private inspection,&rdquo; he
	replied wonderingly.  They exchanged glances.  &ldquo;If they have a
	safe deposit facility here for digital information...&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Then we've got to get in
	there,&rdquo; Sarner finished for him.  Noting that Justin was
	almost out of sight around a bend ahead, he suited action to words. 
	Torch wasn't certain this precipitousness was wise, but he swallowed
	his reservations and followed Sarner to the door and nipped in
	behind him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The room was small, containing
	only a table and a couple of plush chairs.  It was windowless, lit
	from high in the tall ceiling above.  The overhead spot fell
	brightly on the center of the table.  There in a low pile like a
	small pyramid were a half dozen solid gold bars.  Torch could see
	that they were hallmarked with serial numbers and certifications of
	weight and fineness, just like an actual gold bar might be in real
	reality.   The two men stared nonplussed at the glinting bars.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What the hell?&rdquo;
	Sarner wondered aloud.  &ldquo;These can't be real gold.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Of course not, but they
	<I>could</I> correspond to actual bars stored in Aurumnet's custody.
	 If they were quantscans of the real bars, I mean.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So he was doing what,
	inspecting them?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch shook his head.  &ldquo;I
	don't know.  Could be, I suppose.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner thought for a moment.  &ldquo;If
	these are some kind of digital tokens that show ownership of the
	bars, could we just pick them up and take them with us?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch faced Sarner and looked at
	him incredulously.  &ldquo;You want to try and steal them?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Of course not,&rdquo; he
	snapped irritably.  &ldquo;I don't break the law.  We'd merely be
	seizing property that is, very probably, the proceeds of crime.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch laughed.  &ldquo;Well if you
	want to set off probably every alarm in the place, go ahead and pick
	one of those things up,&rdquo; he said gesturing at the piled bars. 
	Sarner looked at the gold speculatively, but kept his hands by his
	side.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Do you think the List could
	be stored in safe-keeping at Aurumnet, too?&rdquo; Sarner asked in a
	low voice.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Maybe, but I don't see why
	it would be.  Granted, they must have really secure data stores, to
	keep all the ownership and transaction records.  But such records
	are always audited, by powerful AIs.  I can't see why he wouldn't be
	afraid that someone else would stumble over the List and guess its
	significance.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner grunted, obviously not
	convinced, still eying the stacked gold.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Shit,&rdquo; Torch said,
	eyes riveted on his scanner.  &ldquo;I think Justin just zoned out
	of here.&rdquo;  He led the way out of the booth and on down the
	hall the way Justin had gone.  Sure enough, there seemed to be an
	exit zone point right near where he had disappeared.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">When they arrived at the terminal
	themselves, Torch considered carefully.   &ldquo;He was the last
	person to use this zone point.  If I can get this scanner to
	synthesize an electronic brain wave pattern that duplicates
	Justin's, I might just be able to fool the terminal into showing me
	where he went.&rdquo;  Torch manipulated some controls.  It was
	really handy to be able to access the design schematics and manuals
	for both the hand-held scanner and the make and model of the zoning
	terminal, just by thinking about it.   He'd never before thought of
	himself as some kind of technical whiz, yet suddenly he had the
	exact cyberverse coordinates Justin had entered only minutes before,
	displayed right there on the terminal.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Hot damn!&rdquo; he
	exclaimed.  &ldquo;You wanna follow him, sir?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner raised his eyebrows as if
	to say, what kind of question is that?  They both grasped the bar
	and Torch pushed the ZONE button.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Bizarrely, they
	found themselves inside a Gothic cathedral.  It was packed with
	well-dressed nobles and churchmen in rich vestments.  They stood at
	what must be the west end of the nave, near the entrance, looking
	across the dense crowd toward the east end, where glorious morning
	sunlight streamed in through the massive clerestory windows high in
	the apse.   It was cool in the cathedral, despite the press of
	bodies, and the sunlight pouring through the stained glass angled in
	from the south.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Their client interfaces had
	adapted to the locality, and each of them was tricked out like a
	lord, with plenty of brocade and those ruffly round collars under
	their chins.   Under the dome at the east end of the church, a
	collection of bishops and lesser clerics were performing some ritual
	concerning a richly dressed man lying oddly prostrate on the floor
	on a rug, with his arms flung out in the attitude of a cross and his
	back to the crowd.   Choirs of monks who were crowded into the north
	and south transepts chanted in Latin, giving responses to the
	priests up front.  But the whispers they could overhear from those
	nearest to them were not in Latin, but in antique French.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What the hell is this?&rdquo;
	Sarner said in a hissing whisper, in modern English.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch gave him a reproving look,
	answered in French.  &ldquo;An historical re-enactment.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner looked exasperated, then
	startled to realize he could understand a language he wasn't aware
	that he knew.  &ldquo;Well I can see that.  But of what?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch was curious about that, too.
	 Abruptly the prone man rose and turned to face the crowd.  Torch
	imaged his face and experimentally requested identification.   At
	once he obtained a very fair match to an historic portrait, and then
	the rest fell into place.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I think that man is Henry
	IV of France, and this must be his coronation,&rdquo; he whispered
	back.  &ldquo;In which case we are standing in a recreation of
	Chartres Cathedral as it existed on 27 February, 1594.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner looked openly baffled,
	shrugged and gestured with his hands as if to ask what was the
	significance.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch shook his head.  &ldquo;I'm
	not sure.  I know Henry had to change his religion in order to
	become king, and later encouraged religious tolerance.&rdquo;  He
	looked around for Justin, who had to be here somewhere.  He studied
	the faces of the clerics up front, but didn't recognize any of them.
	 Then one of the grandly accoutered lords up near the front looked
	behind him momentarily, and Torch's formidable pattern-recognition
	abilities instantly picked out Justin's face.  He scrutinized the
	emblems on the man's embroidered surcoat and matched it against a
	database of family crests of late sixteenth century French nobles.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch tugged on Sarner's sleeve
	and discreetly pointed at the nobleman, who had turned back to face
	forward.  &ldquo;That's Justin over there.  He seems to be playing
	the part of Maximilien de B&eacute;thune, baron de Rosny, Henry's
	right-hand man.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Now Roger Sarner looked completely
	put out.  &ldquo;To what end?  This guy's supposed to be some kind
	of mega genius, why doesn't he just make himself the king?  And
	what's the point of being king over a virtual domain anyway?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch had no good answers for him.
	 But unlike Sarner he wasn't quick to assume that there was no
	point, only that the point was not yet understood.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Someone else, however, was equally
	quick to assume that Torch and Sarner had no business standing there
	muttering at each other during the ceremony.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">My lords, please come
	outside,&rdquo; said an authoritative voice.  They were confronted
	by a very concerned-looking priest, accompanied by several burly
	monks.  A retinue of armed men was visible outside on the cathedral
	steps, looking their way but evidencing reluctance to step into the
	church with drawn weapons.  Torch had no doubt that they would,
	though, if the priest requested it.  He exchanged a glance with
	Sarner and they complied, stepping out among the guardsmen.  A much
	vaster crowd lined the hilltop surrounding the cathedral, obviously
	made up of those not deemed important enough to merit places inside.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The priest and the guard captain
	gave the two visitors the fish eye.  &ldquo;Who are you, sirs?  Are
	you invited guests?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Before Torch could stop him,
	Sarner growled, in English, &ldquo;I don't need your invitation, you
	virtual prick.&rdquo;  Torch winced, despite the fact that a true
	French cleric from 1594 would doubtless have trouble parsing that
	sentence, even if he did speak English.  But the withering,
	disrespectful tone was enough.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They are English!&rdquo;
	someone shouted.  Then another voice: &ldquo;They could be
	assassins, sent by Elizabeth to kill the king for returning to the
	Church!&rdquo;  There was an answering commotion, and the guards
	surged around the pair, weapons bared.   This situation was going
	from bad to worse quickly, Torch reflected.  He suspected Sarner was
	probably unaware that, depending on the rules of the simulation, the
	pain which would be inflicted upon them by those sharp weapons could
	be intense and very real, despite the fact that they could not, of
	course, inflict actual injury upon their physical bodies in
	meatspace.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We're not English,&rdquo;
	he said in perfect, colloquial upper-class French.  &ldquo;And we're
	no assassins.&rdquo;  He gave Sarner a reproving look, suggesting
	that he correct his language deficiency.  Unfortunately, he did more
	than that.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No, we're not,&rdquo; he
	agreed, also in French.  &ldquo;Though your king will in fact be
	assassinated, in 1610 if I recall correctly.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The priest gaped at him.  &ldquo;And
	how would you know that, my lord?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner sneered.  &ldquo;Because it
	happened more than four hundred years ago, you idiot.   In real
	life.  But this isn't real, and you don't even exist.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch sighed, wondering where the
	nearest zone point might be.  Obviously the die was now cast, so he
	might as well explain what was about to happen to his associate. 
	&ldquo;AIs in simulations are usually programmed to react
	appropriately to whatever is inappropriate to the simulation, you
	know,&rdquo; he said over his shoulder.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They're not spies, they're
	witches!&rdquo; someone yelled, and cries of &ldquo;demon&rdquo; and
	&ldquo;sorcerer&rdquo; rang out through the crowd.  The priest
	gestured angrily and they felt the heavy hands of the guards on
	their shoulders.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You are under arrest,&rdquo;
	the guard captain expostulated.  &ldquo;Move!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They were frog-marched down the
	hillside and into town.   Torch offered no resistance, and signaled
	Sarner to do likewise, because he had found and interrogated an
	administrative interface, and discovered that the nearest exit zone
	point was hidden in a tree trunk on the far side of town.  So at
	present they were going in the right direction anyway.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But as soon as the men wanted to
	turn aside into a foreboding building that evidently housed some
	kind of gaol, he nodded at Sarner.   The two men then turned on
	their captors.  Applying superhuman strength and reflexes, to say
	nothing of martial arts techniques completely unknown in France of
	this period, they quickly demolished the guard squad and left them
	writhing in the muddy street, gasping for breath and holding various
	painful parts of their anatomies in lieu of their weapons.  Then
	they sprinted away, Torch in the lead, heading for the exit.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">An angry roar of townspeople and
	soldiers pursued them, carrying whatever weapons were ready to hand.
	 With tireless superior speed, they were able to keep ahead of the
	spreading uproar clear to the far side of the town.   The situation
	was so ludicrously like one of those old movies with the peasants
	chasing after the supernatural baddies with torches and pitchforks
	that Sarner had to laugh as he ran.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch spotted what must be the
	right tree up ahead, and angled toward it.  As they ran up, suddenly
	they could see the control console through the trunk as though it
	were superimposed on the bark.  Torch entered coordinates, saying
	&ldquo;Grab hold!&rdquo; as he did so.  They gripped the tree as
	Torch hit the button.   Reformation era France faded.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They emerged in a library, filled
	with old books and the smell of antiques.  Roger broke out laughing.
	 &ldquo;That was kinda fun.  Did you see the looks on their faces? 
	I can almost see why some people get addicted to doing this kind of
	shit.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch tried to keep his disgust
	off his face, not entirely successfully.  &ldquo;That's beside the
	point.  Sir.  The fact is, we left before we learned anything
	useful, and now we can't track Justin through his next zone.  Even
	worse, if he hears about what happened, he may deduce that he's
	being followed.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner shrugged.  &ldquo;He
	couldn't know who's doing it, or why, or that we can pick up his
	trail again.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch shook his head.  &ldquo;You
	hope.  I'm going back to Chartres, using a reconfigured avatar, to
	stake out the tree and see if I can find out where he goes next,
	same way I did before.  Why don't you zone out?  I'll message you
	when I have something.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Right.  Fine.&rdquo; 
	Sarner didn't look the least bit contrite, and Torch understood that
	no apology for the inconvenience would be forthcoming.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The library's card catalog was the
	zone terminal.  Torch went over to it and reversed his last zone. 
	He had no idea where Secretary Sarner would decide to go, and right
	at the moment he couldn't care less, so long as it was someplace
	else.</FONT><P ALIGN=CENTER>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif"><FONT SIZE=2>* * * * * * * * * *</FONT></FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Later that day,
	Sarner rejoined him in the next virtuality that Justin visited after
	Chartres, to which Torch had tracked him without much difficulty.  
	It was a white sandy beach on a hot summer day.  From the visual
	clues presented by nearby buildings, vehicles, signs, and the
	clothing people were wearing, Torch estimated that the setting was
	somewhere on the Spanish Riviera in the late 1990s.  Not that there
	was much clothing in evidence.  The group of people splashing in the
	surf close at hand were all young women, and they were all topless.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner looked over at the women
	and broke out laughing.  &ldquo;Hoo boy, the great genius sure
	spends his time living in a geek's paradise.  From gold magnate to
	king maker to playboy.  Gotta love it.  Hey, maybe he'll be pope in
	the next one, and give himself absolution.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch gave him a dark look. 
	&ldquo;We're here to track him and see where he goes, until he
	visits the world where the List is.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yeah, well this ain't it,
	unless you think one of those honeys has it stuffed in her bikini
	bottom.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I doubt it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So do I.  For one thing,
	there sure wouldn't be room to hide it.&rdquo;  He laughed again,
	started walking over to the women.  They saw the two men approaching
	over the sand, came prancing out of the water, and stood in a loose
	semicircle to meet them.  <I>Damn</I>, Torch thought.  Some of those
	girls really had a prance on them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Hi ladies,&rdquo; Roger
	said as they reached easy conversation range, this time wisely using
	Spanish without being prompted.  They smiled and waved.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What can we do for you, big
	boys?&rdquo; one said.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch grinned.  &ldquo;We're
	looking for a dude, white, about five nine or ten, sandy blond hair,
	pale blue eyes, slim build.  You seen him?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The senoritas laughed.  &ldquo;You
	got all of us here, sweetie, and you're looking for a guy?  How
	disappointing.&rdquo;  They laughed some more.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner's smile was wide but cold. 
	&ldquo;It's business, see?  We're following him.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I think this one must be a
	cop,&rdquo; one senorita said in a pretended aside to her friend.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yeah,&rdquo; the friend
	replied in a stage whisper.  &ldquo;You can see the donuts.&rdquo; 
	More laughter.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner drew himself up slightly
	and Torch was getting the feeling that he might be about to say
	something inappropriate to the simulation again, but just then he
	noticed a strange thing.  There were footprints in the sand going
	along the beach.  He'd assumed at first glance that one of the girls
	had made them, but they led all the way down the shore, and unlike
	the ones the bathing beauties had left, these weren't fading away as
	the waves rolled over them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Who made those footprints?&rdquo;
	Torch asked, pointing, forestalling whatever Sarner was going to
	say.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The merriment died down.  One
	girl, a tanned raven-haired beauty whose bodily proportions were
	just... achingly perfect, met his eyes with a sad little smile of
	genuine regret.  &ldquo;Oh, a cute blond guy, about five foot ten,&rdquo;
	she replied with a sigh.  &ldquo;He went through here a little while
	ago, and he didn't stay, either.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch felt a flash of empathetic
	sorrow.  These women were clearly AIs who were programmed to be,
	well, what every young man desired.  He understood that the
	sophistication of their emotional responses made them susceptible to
	loneliness.  And that they had to stay here, whether anyone came to
	walk on their beach or not.  How long had it been since they had
	last seen a visitor, before Justin arrived?  There was no way to
	tell.  Or to tell how long it might be until the next, or until this
	simulation fell completely out of use and was abruptly discontinued
	by its operators.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Would that be death to these
	beautiful, friendly, desirable Spanish women?   Or would they
	someday be recycled into another virtual creation, to live again,
	and love again?  <I>If they weren't, it would be a damned waste</I>,
	he thought.  Torch found himself wanting to comfort them, even to
	take them with him away from this place to somewhere they could live
	and be happy.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was odd, really, that normally
	he just didn't think of virtual AIs as beings in need of fulfillment
	or affection, especially considering that quite a lot of them
	existed at or even above biological human norms for intelligence,
	both analytical and emotional.   Did created AIs like these women
	have a right to pursue freedom, and happiness, and
	self-determination, the fulfillment of their goals and desires, just
	as those who had been born human did?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch wanted the answer to be yes,
	and he hoped desperately that this dusky girl could read that
	sentiment in his eyes.  At the same time, he knew that he personally
	had nothing to give to any of these women.  They weren't Cylara. 
	And that was really all there was to it.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm really, truly sorry
	that we cannot stay,&rdquo; he said softly.  &ldquo;But we must
	follow the man who made the footprints.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The women nodded somberly.  The
	perfect dark-haired one reached out and touched Torch lightly on the
	shoulder, for just a moment.  The touch of her sweet fingers was
	somehow searing.  &ldquo;You're in love with another,&rdquo; she
	said simply.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes,&rdquo; he replied. 
	She smiled, eyes sparkling with mingled mischief and regret.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner looked at him sidelong,
	obviously trying to deduce just what had passed between Torch and
	this clutch of girls who had been so rowdy a moment ago and were now
	so serious.  Torch said nothing, but beckoned him to follow as he
	set off down the beach along the line of footprints.  They could
	hear the laughter and the splashing as the women ran back into the
	surf behind them.  Torch forced himself not to look back.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It made no sense to him that the
	sea wouldn't wash away Justin's footprints.  Their own, like the
	girls', washed away without trace in only a few wave impulses.  What
	made Justin's special?  How was it possible to alter the rules of a
	virtuality like this, merely by walking through it?  And why was
	Justin doing it?  Did he indeed realize that he was being followed,
	and left them a plain trail so they could do it more easily?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">If that was the case, then he'd
	probably be lying in wait somewhere up ahead, hoping to discover who
	was tracking him, and why.  Which was a rather sobering thought.  
	Still, Torch's feeling was that the business with the footprints was
	incidental, or at any rate served some other purpose besides the
	obvious. </FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As he trudged
	down the beach through the heavy, wet sand, Torch was reminded of
	the old anecdote about the man who had complained to the Lord that
	during the hardest parts of his life, there was but one set of
	footprints in the sand behind him.  And the answer of course was
	that during those times the Lord had been carrying him rather than
	walking beside him.   Was that the message, that God was carrying
	Justin through these times of trial?  That didn't sound right, yet
	the more he thought about it the more Torch became convinced that
	this trail in the sand was intended as a message of <I>some</I>
	sort.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You could have been right,&rdquo;
	Sarner admitted heavily after they'd walked a while.  Torch
	understood intuitively that apologizing for mistakes wasn't
	something that came easily to this man.  &ldquo;Maybe he does know
	he's being followed.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That thought had occurred
	to me,&rdquo; Torch agreed.  &ldquo;As has the thought that maybe
	he's always known.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner let that go unanswered for
	a good number of steps.  &ldquo;Meaning you think he wanted us to
	follow him, from the beginning.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Maybe.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In that case, presumably
	we'll be walking into some kind of trap at some point.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch shrugged.  There wasn't
	really much danger they could run into within a virtuality.  There
	were ways to make one dangerous, but not physically, only
	psychologically.  But somehow that didn't seem to be Justin's style.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A house came into view.  It was
	painted white, with a white corrugated steel roof, pentagonal, built
	on a point of land thrust out into the surf, perched on a rocky
	ridge some twenty feet above the high tide mark.  It was suddenly
	obvious that Justin's tracks must lead to it, since there was no
	other discernible destination in sight.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They approached the building
	cautiously.  Sure enough, Justin's tracks disappeared at the base of
	a wooden plank staircase that ran up the rock face to the house. 
	They watched for a while, looking for evidence of movement inside. 
	Seeing none, after several minutes they stealthily climbed the
	stairway.  The outside door of the beach house was unlocked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Moving in swiftly but silently
	(Sarner evidencing his long-ago police training in the decisive yet
	deliberate cat-footed way he moved) they quickly ascertained that
	there was nobody in the building now.  Torch pulled out their brain
	wave profile scanner and confirmed that Justin had recently zoned
	away from here.  Which meant that the house must contain a zone
	point.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Aha, over here at the wet bar. 
	Torch beckoned Sarner over, activated the panel.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So he zoned in here, walked
	a couple miles down the beach, and zoned out again.  What for?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Visiting memories?  Who
	knows.&rdquo;  Torch studied the controls, again used their scanner
	to conjure up a fake Justin fingerprint which fooled the console
	into redisplaying its last destination setting.  He was getting
	adept at this.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So where'd he go next?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Place called Palandria. 
	I've heard of it.  Some kind of mesh tribe fantasy world, an old
	one.  Swords and sorcery, that sort of thing.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner snorted.  &ldquo;More geek
	stuff.  Okay, bring on the dragons and unicorns.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The landscape
	looked distinctly volcanic.  The rocks were dark and rough, and
	nothing grew on them.  Bits of pumice crunched underfoot.  Wisps of
	smoke or steam eddied along the ground in places.  They were in a
	valley hemmed in on three sides by steep, basaltic cliffs.  Frowning
	grey clouds loomed over the tops of the ridges, billowing slowly. 
	On the fourth side, behind them, the valley opened out into lowlands
	which began to be dotted with green: bushes, stunted trees, patches
	of grass.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Directly ahead of them was a kind
	of ruinous stone structure, roughly circular, largely fallen down,
	with shattered pillars and collapsed arches lying where they had
	fallen, as if hurled there by some colossal earthquake in ancient
	times long ago.  One lone archway was still intact, and gave
	entrance into the courtyard of the fortress, or monastery, or
	whatever the structure had once been.  Just inside the intact arch
	stood a kind of tent, or perhaps a tepee, of irregular shape, made
	of hides rather than canvas.  A fire crackled beside its dark
	entrance, and a ragged old crone bent over the fire to tend it.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch knew from experience that
	settings and personages such as these were usually related to quests
	of some sort.  Since they were in fact on a kind of quest
	themselves, this felt encouragingly appropriate.  One other
	observation also occurred to him: this was obviously no ordinary
	entrance zone point.  In worlds of this kind, such were usually
	located around towns and settlements established in friendly, or at
	at any rate less dangerous, territory.  This must be a private or
	elite entry point to which Justin had access.  Which meant that in
	game world terms, they were probably in a danger zone.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch shared his assessment with
	Sarner succinctly, and moved toward the old woman.  She straightened
	up, leaning on a thorny walking stick, and awaited them.  When they
	reached her camp, Torch bowed and greeted her respectfully.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You are come to the ruins
	of the Courts of Minos,&rdquo; she informed them sternly, looking
	them up and down.  &ldquo;You should not enter here.  You do not
	possess the necessary skills.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We have special skills
	which are not apparent, madam,&rdquo; Torch returned with another
	bow.  &ldquo;And we are on quest, under a geas.  We have no other
	choice.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The crone's piercing eyes stabbed
	at Torch, as if measuring his sincerity as well as his worthiness. 
	&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said at last.  &ldquo;As the Guardian,
	I must inform you that you have only two choices.  You must go up,
	or you must go down.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Up or down to where?&rdquo;
	Sarner asked impatiently.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">To your destiny, of course.
	 Up will take you to the center, where you may see much but touch
	nothing.  Down will take you into the maze, which also leads to the
	center, but where that which you perceive may also touch you.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Then, Guardian, we must go
	down,&rdquo; Torch said at once.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Guardian laughed raucously. 
	&ldquo;You will not survive the maze.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Nevertheless we must
	attempt it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Very well then.&rdquo;  She
	stamped the heel of her stick on the ground beside her foot three
	times.  A nearby wall appeared to vanish, revealing a stairway
	descending into the earth, lit by flickering torchlight.  Torch and
	Sarner exchanged a look, and the latter rolled his eyes.  They
	walked away toward the stairs.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">One matter more,&rdquo; the
	Guardian called warningly.   They paused.  &ldquo;What you seek lies
	within.  But unless it is truly yours, you will not possess it.&rdquo;
	 She cackled again.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Whatever,&rdquo; Sarner
	muttered.  &ldquo;Let's go.&rdquo;  He led the way down the stairs,
	picking up a lighted lamp depending from a hook on the wall.  As
	Torch followed him and did likewise, there was a grating sound and
	the passage closed behind them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">At the bottom of a short incline,
	the tunnel opened out into a wide, empty space, too vast for their
	lamplight to reach across.  A number of tunnels appeared to radiate
	outward from the cavern, like the spokes of a wheel.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The List really could be
	here, I think,&rdquo; Torch opined.  That brought Sarner up short.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What makes you say that?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Because this world is old,
	going back about twenty years.  There are few older.  And I seem to
	recall reading somewhere that Justin was a founding member here. 
	He's some kind of arch wizard.  And this maze.  It's a perfect
	hiding place.  That old seeress was right.  We'll probably never
	reach the center.  It'll be guarded by monsters we have no chance
	against.  In this world, we're what's called noobs.  We haven't
	acquired the weapons, or the skills, or the magic that would be
	required to negotiate an advanced dungeon such as this.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What kind of monsters are
	you expecting?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well, the Courts of Minos,
	with a maze, what does that suggest to you?  Think about Greek
	mythology.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You think about it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I have, and I think you're
	probably not the only bull-headed man I'll see in here.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A minotaur?&rdquo; Sarner
	said incredulously after a moment.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Probably <I>The</I>
	Minotaur.  I imagine he's the boss monster at the center.  And just
	possibly, he's also the guardian of the Master Node List.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But why wouldn't someone
	have taken it by now?  I mean, the point of these dungeon
	simulations is for the players to go in and kill the monsters and
	get the treasure, right?  So even if we don't have the magic or
	whatever to do that, there would be players who do, right?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Presumably.  But remember
	what the Guardian said: if it doesn't belong to us, we won't get it.
	 To me that suggests that the only way the Minotaur will give up the
	List when he's defeated is if the players who kill him are on the
	proper step in a series of goals, known as a quest.  Otherwise they
	won't get credit, even if they win.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Are you saying we're going
	to have to waste a bunch of time playing a stupid game, to do all
	the quest prerequisites and gain the necessary skills, before we can
	get the List off the Minotaur?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That's possible.  Think
	about it.  It makes sense.  Justin is an expert at this game, a
	top-ranked player of long standing.  Any world such as this has its
	own internal logic, which is inescapable, as immutable as
	light-speed.  What this means is that here, he can hide the List in
	a place where almost no one else can get to it, but he can.   And if
	anybody starts going through the quest sequence, he'll probably find
	out about it long before they get to the final step.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner was obviously peeved.  &ldquo;But
	how can something real get hidden in a goddamned game world?&rdquo;
	he asked indignantly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Mr. Sarner, it's just data,
	like any other virtual item.  In this world it's probably
	instantiated as a stone tablet or an ancient scroll or something.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And if we start doing the
	quest for the Tablet of the Minotaur or whatever, Justin will
	probably hear about it, come running to head us off, and turn us
	into newts or something.  That's just freaking fantastic.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I don't know.  But before
	we decide to start training up our squads as Dark Age Ascending
	players, I'd like to take a trip to the center to confirm whether
	there is a Minotaur, and maybe something that might be the List.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I thought you said we'd
	never make it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I also said we had special
	abilities that weren't apparent,&rdquo; Torch returned smugly.  He
	pulled the brain pattern scanner out of his pocket and fiddled with
	its controls, again generating an electrical pattern like Justin's
	electromagnetic brain-wave signature.   He waved it about and when
	nothing happened, turned up the gain to maximum.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A glaucous thread of light, like
	an etiolated vine, appeared twisting in midair.  It lead down into
	the cavern and across it at an angle toward one of the exits. 
	Experimentally, Torch took a couple of steps along the path it
	marked out, and the hovering line brightened and seemed to extend
	further.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He left himself a map,&rdquo;
	concluded Sarner.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes,&rdquo; Torch agreed. 
	&ldquo;Like the thread Theseus and Ariadne used in the mythical
	Labyrinth on Crete.  Which indicates that a safe path to the center
	must exist.  Uber wizard or not, Justin would hardly want to have to
	fight his way down every time he paid a call on the Minotaur.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Good thinking, Cleary,&rdquo;
	Sarner complimented.  &ldquo;Let's go.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They followed the ribbon of pale
	green light down a wide, echoing tunnel.  Soon they began to take
	turnings left or right, and up or down flights of uneven steps,
	negotiating the bewildering branchings of a vast underground maze. 
	There were more stairs down than up, and passages that seemed to
	spiral inwards and downwards.  Nothing was marked or labeled, and
	frequently their course selected the narrower or less obvious way at
	intersections.  Faint howls and rustlings came distantly to their
	ears, and scurrying and muttering beings seemed at times to be ahead
	of them, or close behind them.  Once while crossing a large hall, a
	dimly glimpsed bulk moved ponderously just beyond the reach of their
	lamps.  The Labyrinth smelled dank, with a musty decaying smell,
	sometimes drier and sometimes fresher and wetter, like rotting
	leaves.    Occasionally they stumbled over what appeared to be the
	bones of unknown creatures.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There was absolutely no doubt that
	the place was a gigantic trap, and that absent their traversal of a
	safe route through it, their passage downward would have been
	ferocious.  And probably almost immediately fatal to their
	unskilled, unequipped virtual avatars.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">All at once they ducked through
	yet another low adit and found themselves in an immense torchlit
	fane.  A grand building made of marble, like something whole from
	the Acropolis, stood on top of a pyramid of tall, deep steps.  It
	looked like a temple, but appeared to house a library.  Something,
	some distant light source, shone faintly on the roof of the library
	from above.  Torch gasped, realizing that it was probably daylight. 
	The whole immense chamber appeared deserted.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Maybe he's not at home,&rdquo;
	Sarner speculated.  &ldquo;You think that library contains our
	data?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It would be a good bet,&rdquo;
	Torch breathed.  &ldquo;I wonder if we can get to it?&rdquo;  Their
	twisting map line had terminated here, but he kept the scanner
	switched on anyway, in case there was anything else here that was
	programmed to be more friendly to Justin than to some random
	interloper.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Nothing ventured...&rdquo;
	reproved Sarner, and started toward the steps.  They had to
	negotiate the steps one by one, scrambling up to the top of each
	before the next could be attempted.  They were evidently scaled for
	gods, or for giants.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">At the entrance to the library,
	Torch looked up.  Sure enough, there high above was a tiny square
	patch of blue, with a small thin cloud scooting across it.  There
	seemed to be a balcony up there at the top of the shaft, too.  And
	was that someone standing on it?  Difficult to tell.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner strode boldly into the
	library, checking out the labeling on the thousands of pigeonholes
	containing scrolls, and written beneath the shelves holding books
	and tablets.  The lettering appeared to be Greek at first glance,
	but upon closer inspection proved to be something unrecognizable. 
	Torch supposed it must be some Palandrian language, but one which
	his mesh interface for once could not identify.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A dark, guttural voice pronounced
	something aloud which could well be in the same language.  Torch and
	Sarner looked around, alarmed, but could see nothing.  Then a very
	tall man stepped around a pillar to confront them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He was easily ten feet in height,
	maybe twelve, strongly built, especially above the waist, so that he
	looked top-heavy.  He was clad in studded leather armor, and had the
	head, or at any rate the face, of a bull.  The horns on his head
	were the only non-canonical element to his appearance: they seemed
	to be incorporeal, made of some kind of pulsing energy, a dark sea
	green in color.  The horns danced and flickered on top of his head,
	rising and falling in a rhythm almost like respiration.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Minotaur looked genuinely
	flummoxed for a moment, then indignant.  He pointed at the scanner
	device in Torch's hand, and said something else.  Torch didn't
	understand his rumbling, but got the point.  He switched off the
	scanner and put it away.  The Minotaur pointed at them, uttered
	something else in an angry tone.  Again the meaning was obvious:
	they did not belong here.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch made placating gestures with
	his open hands, backing away slowly out of the library.  Sarner
	edged along beside him, also facing the monster, his face clenched
	somewhere between snide amusement and fearful apprehension.  The
	Minotaur bowed his head toward them, bending mainly from the neck so
	that his bovine muzzle sank to his chest.  Torch was just wondering
	whether this was some formal or ritualistic greeting to which he
	must respond, when he realized that the beast was pointing his
	glowing horns at them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He started to shout a warning just
	as the horns flared.  What looked like an impossible kaleidoscope of
	fragmented virtualities rippled toward them, as if the Minotaur had
	shot at them with a machinegun that fired holographic projections of
	scenes from hundreds of worlds.  The projected images did not strike
	them, but encased both men in cocoons of faceted and whirling
	planes, like a hall of mirrors with a hundred surfaces each
	providing a view into a distinct universe.  It was bewildering
	beyond comprehension, yet maddeningly fascinating.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I don't think we can
	escape,&rdquo; Torch said as calmly as he could.  &ldquo;I think
	we'd better drop our connections and zone back out to our jacks.&rdquo;
	 Sarner grunted agreement, shading his eyes from the whirling
	micro-portals into alternate realities that danced and spun before
	them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Somehow it didn't work.  No matter
	how many times he activated the manual emergency disconnect, the
	interface did not respond.   Torch felt a clutch of cold panic. 
	Something in the sensory stimulus overload must be blocking the
	command link.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Why can't we leave?&rdquo;
	Roger Sarner hollered, characteristically sounding as angry as he
	was frightened.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Suddenly, Torch thought he
	understood.  Every one of these projections was a potential zone
	point.  If they gave their full attention to any one of them, they
	would fall into it.  The presence of so many zone thresholds around
	them must be overloading the control interface with a feedback loop,
	making disconnection impossible.  A chill smote him, almost like a
	physical blow between the shoulder blades.  What would happen if
	they zoned involuntarily at random?  Would they then be able to
	disconnect normally?  Or would the feedback jamming persist in their
	new location?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Only one way to find out.  Torch
	selected one of the myriad jittering picture frames around him and
	focused on it to the exclusion of all else.  It showed a meadow full
	of butterflies, with a brook winding lazily through it.  Innocuous
	enough.  Suddenly he was there!  A few cattle grazing in the pasture
	looked up, startled at his sudden appearance.  The simple buzz of
	bees and birdsong sounded loud and glad in his ears after the tinsel
	cacophony he'd been shutting out.  He breathed a sigh of relief, and
	triggered his interface disconnection again.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And with a swirl he was back in
	the Minotaur's cavern, amid the gyre of beckoning virtualities. 
	Sarner was on his knees, groaning and hiding his eyes.  &ldquo;Cleary!&rdquo;
	he bellowed.  &ldquo;Get us out of this!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif"><I>If only I knew how</I>, Torch
	thought.  He'd been wrong, stupidly wrong.  Justin did have a trap
	waiting, and there was after all a way to make a virtuality
	dangerous.  Or in this case, a thousand virtualities dangerous. 
	Torch looked around, trying to focus beyond the screen of maddening
	facets, but he could no longer see the Minotaur clearly.  Perhaps he
	had moved away again after trapping his victims.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Desperately, Torch looked upward. 
	There, forever out of reach, was that distant blot of sky.  Could he
	focus on that, and resist the pull of the wheeling worlds?  &ldquo;Look
	straight up!&rdquo; he yelled at Sarner.  &ldquo;Stare at the sky
	and concentrate on it!&rdquo;  In his peripheral vision he sensed
	Sarner rise and dizzily comply.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">At that balcony up there.  Was
	there &ndash; there <I>was</I> someone standing on it, someone
	waving.  Excitedly, Torch waved back.  The figure's motions changed,
	and something else that was moving caught his eye as well.  It
	twitched back and forth, wiggling, approaching, getting closer. 
	Suddenly he understood.  The person up top was lowering a rope!  One
	with a weight on it, headed directly for him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The weight, a large lava stone,
	swung through the glittering portals without shattering them, or
	zoning into them.  Torch caught it, tugged on the rope sharply a few
	times, and it stopped descending.  He was wondering what to do about
	Sarner when a second weighted rope came spiraling down.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Catch the rope,&rdquo; he
	told the boss.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Right, I see it.&rdquo; 
	Once Sarner was also holding a rope, they stood expectantly.  But
	the ropes did not rise to lift them up.  After a moment, Torch
	started climbing.  He half expected to feel some restraint from the
	trap, or worse, the grasping giant hands of the Minotaur clamping
	like vises on his legs.  But there was nothing, and he climbed
	vertically straight out of the trap.  Sarner, beside him, did
	likewise.  This would be no problem.  It was what, a couple of
	hundred yards?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Exultant, tireless, no longer
	scared, Torch climbed eagerly hand over hand.  The figure at the
	projecting balcony seemed to be climbing too, going back up a spiral
	stair cut in the side of the shaft.   That was odd.  Why wouldn't
	their rescuer wait?  At the very lip of the mine shaft, the figure
	now stood, looking down.  By its size and shape, it was a woman. 
	But not the old crone from the entrance.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch reached the balcony and
	clambered onto it.  Without waiting for Sarner, who was a few
	seconds behind him, he started up the stone stair leading out of the
	Minotaur's pit.  As he rounded the curve he got a clear view up at
	the standing figure, upon whose face the sunlight was now shining.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The hand that he was raising in
	tentative greeting froze in mid-motion.  It was Cylara.  He found
	that he could not speak.   Though he desperately wanted to say
	something, as with a steely expression she turned silently away and
	vanished.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cy!&rdquo; he shouted, and
	sprinted up the rest of the steps.  Blinded and dizzy, he staggered
	around in the bright, smoky sunshine, spinning wildly to spot her
	retreating figure.  He stood at the top of a vast circular pile of
	rubble and boulders and fallen masonry that led down in all
	directions. But she was nowhere in sight.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Roger Sarner hustled up out of the
	pit a moment later, to find Torch cast down upon the bare, gravely
	ground at the edge, his head in his hands.  He perceived that the
	young man was overwrought about something, but didn't know what. 
	The narrowness of their escape, perhaps.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Good job down there,
	getting us out of that.&rdquo;  Torch did not respond.  &ldquo;Where's
	that person with the ropes?&rdquo; he continued after a moment.  &ldquo;I
	suppose we should thank them.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yeah,&rdquo; Torch said at
	last.  But in truth he wasn't sure he would ever have the chance to
	thank her.  Bitterly, he recalled the ancient Guardian's words: <I>w</I><I>hat
	you seek lies within, but unless it is truly yours you will not
	possess it</I>.  His lover very likely knew who and what he was,
	now.  And so now she would never be his.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif"><I>Then what was left</I>?  he
	asked himself.  He had no answer.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma returned to
	the gathering with a stunned look on her face.   The others were
	sitting in a casual group on various bits of lawn furniture that
	were scattered around the clearing.  The setting was a warm
	afternoon in a cool, fragrant deciduous forest.  Sunlight dappled
	the ground and the breeze blew gently, scenting the air and making
	the temperature perfect.   Clay and his boss, Stefan, occupied two
	chairs, having an animated discussion with Petrov and his tall,
	olive-skinned wife Shanti.  Clay had welcomed the chance to meet the
	celebrated Petrov in a social setting, and asked Salma to accompany
	him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma had been called away in
	response to an almost frantic PM from her friend Cylara, and had
	zoned away to meet with her briefly.  As she rejoined the others,
	they looked up at her silent approach and correctly read the

	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What's happened?&rdquo;
	Clay asked at once.  &ldquo;You look like you should sit down,&rdquo;
	he said taking her hand and guiding her into a chair.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma wasn't sure how to approach

	just told me that she's discovered something shocking about Torch.

	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Are you sure, Salma?&rdquo;

	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yeah.  But Cy told me that

	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And she's sure it was him?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Uh-huh.  Apparently she's

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay sighed.  &ldquo;Shit.  And he
	knows a lot about the Cyberantes.  If he's giving information to the

	immediately.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Relax, Clay,&rdquo; Petrov
	said warmly, waving him back into his seat.  Shanti smiled at her

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay was dumbstruck.  Finally he
	managed, &ldquo;Then why didn't you tell us?  That seems like a
	helluva risk to take.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov shrugged.  &ldquo;No
	greater than the risk that you wouldn't have been able to hide your
	suspicions.  Which might have tipped him off that he was getting bad
	information.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma felt a flash of annoyance on
	behalf of her friend.  &ldquo;If there was one person who deserved
	to be told, it was Cylara.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov disagreed.  &ldquo;The one
	person who didn't need to be told, because she would figure it out
	for herself.  Telling her that her boyfriend was a traitor would
	have been needlessly cruel.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And her discovering it on
	her own makes it less cruel?&rdquo; she retorted with some heat.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Of course not.  But I said
	<I>needlessly</I> cruel.  This way, a positive result can come from
	it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma felt anger at this cold
	calculation, yet sensed that Petrov was genuinely a compassionate
	man, unlikely to be cheered by anyone else's suffering.  Shanti put
	a calming hand on her arm.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Would you say that Torch
	and Cylara truly love one another?&rdquo; she asked calmly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I would.  I mean, I would
	have said so, yes.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well then.&rdquo;  Shanti's
	fathomless dark eyes stared at Salma, as if encouraging her to jump
	to some obvious conclusion.  But to her, it wasn't at all obvious
	what good result could be expected to emerge here.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She's breaking up with
	him,&rdquo; she added matter-of-factly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Which is understandable,
	don't you think?&rdquo; Stefan asked.  Salma could but nod.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Okay, so Cylara's dumping
	him,&rdquo; Clay said.  &ldquo;What should the rest of us do about
	it?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'd recommend doing
	nothing,&rdquo; Petrov replied evenly.  &ldquo;Torch will absent
	himself from your lives and the affairs of the Cyberantes
	voluntarily.  He'll be too ashamed to show his face.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara thinks Torch and
	Sarner were following Justin,&rdquo; Salma went on after a moment.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov raised a bushy eyebrow. 
	&ldquo;Good.  As long as they keep on doing that, the uneasy peace
	in meatspace between the Federation and its enemies will endure.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay came to an abrupt conclusion.
	 &ldquo;You people are playing for time.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Petrov grinned.  &ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Time for what?&rdquo; Salma
	inquired archly.  She didn't much like these revelations of
	mysterious plots and counter plots.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Time enough to forge a
	lasting peace,&rdquo; Shanti offered in a reassuring tone.  There
	was a silence.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I wish I could believe that
	was really possible,&rdquo; said Clay.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Selah, the pet leopard that
	belonged to Shanti and Petrov, came loping into the clearing.  She
	ran straight to Salma, put her paws up on her shoulders and began
	licking her face.  Pushing vainly at the big cat and twisting her
	face from side to side, Salma had to laugh.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It looks like Selah

	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That's not true Cy,&rdquo;

	together.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A fringe benefit, mixing

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch shook his head unhappily. 
	He'd known she was going to be furious, but had been mistaken about
	the principal cause of her ire.  He'd walked in here bursting with
	arguments to justify why he was helping the enemy, to explain why
	he'd chosen the side that he had.  And even willing to admit that he
	was no longer sure whether he'd made the right choice.  But it
	turned out that that was only a side issue for her.  Her main
	problem was that she felt he had used her.  Which in a way he
	supposed he had, but it was never all lies on his side.  He
	genuinely cared about her and wanted to be with her.  But how could
	he make her see that?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They stood in a virtual garden, a
	bucolic place boasting many a lovers' lane and plenty of dells and
	copses for picnics and solitary trysts.  A nearby fountain splashed
	softly in its basin, oblivious to their quarrel.  Apropos of the
	mood of their meeting, the sky was overcast and threatening.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cy, everything I did was so
	that we could be together,&rdquo; he offered wistfully.  The rage on
	her face became mixed with puzzlement.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">How do you figure that?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Because virtuality has to
	be destroyed.  And when it is, all those who are redeemed will live
	together in real reality, the way it was meant to be.  I wanted us
	to be together.  I wanted to marry you.  I still do.&rdquo;  Torch
	could almost see the thoughts whirling behind her eyes as she parsed
	the implications.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The cyberverse will never
	be destroyed,&rdquo; she snapped.  &ldquo;And haven't I told you,
	several times, that I have absolutely no wish to spend my life in
	meatspace?  How selfish of you, <I>Daniel,</I> to plan for what you
	want and pay no attention at all to what I want.  How can you
	possibly have a marriage that isn't mutual?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I...  I thought that once
	you accepted the fact that you couldn't live in virtuality anymore,
	once you got over it, that you'd want to live with me.  It isn't
	something I'm doing to you, Cy.  It's what the world is doing, it's
	what God's doing, it's fate!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">How convenient, that fate
	is conspiring to bring you what you want,&rdquo; she said
	sarcastically.  Then she flared: &ldquo;How can you possibly believe
	in anything so stupid!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch was stung by this, not
	because she was calling him stupid (he'd been called worse), but
	because this sounded like a militant declaration of unbelief on her
	part.  Which sparked a fear, like a tightness in his chest, that his
	plans for her were after all impossible.  He desperately didn't want
	that to be true.  He tried calm reason again.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Plenty of people, even
	highly intelligent people, believe in the divine and in the guiding
	hand of providence.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Maybe so.  But to believe
	that providence is leading us toward the destruction of the
	cyberverse is completely crazy.  Haven't you been paying attention? 
	Can't you forget about your prophesies for long enough to look
	around you and notice who's winning?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There are some things you
	don't know, Cylara,&rdquo; he said sadly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No doubt.  And if you think
	your twisted old man and that pathetic backstreet thug I saw you

	isn't living in real reality.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Please leave my father out
	of this,&rdquo; he said quietly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">How can I?  When it's
	plainly your repressive upbringing which has warped you into a
	confused copy of him?   Torch, you'd be a decent guy if you weren't
	so totally hung up on these idiot notions about how people <I>ought</I>
	to live.  Like there was one right way to do it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You can't live happily
	without having your life grounded on a sound moral foundation,&rdquo;
	he averred.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She looked exasperated, and her
	voice rose to a perceptibly higher pitch.  &ldquo;I'm not talking
	about morality!  That has nothing to do with whether people live in
	virtuality or not.  Morality is about how you live, wherever you
	are.  You can be moral or immoral in any world.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No, it isn't.  You can't
	live righteously in a virtual world.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This stopped her for a moment. 
	&ldquo;And why can't you?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He looked steadily and seriously
	into her face.  &ldquo;Because in the flesh is how God made us. 
	It's how we are.  And how we're meant to stay.&rdquo;  No sooner had
	he said these words, in which he'd always believed, then he wondered
	how he really knew they were true.   Was she right, and he was just
	parroting what he'd been told all his life, without examination?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara shook her head sadly.  &ldquo;And
	you wonder why I can't leave your crazy old man out of this?  You
	sound just like him.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">My father is a man of deep
	convictions,&rdquo; Torch explained.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Your father is a man of
	immense unreasoning prejudices,&rdquo; she accused.  &ldquo;To say
	nothing of the overweening arrogance of presuming to impose his
	insane dogma on everybody else.  Which is exactly what you meant to
	do to me.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch hung his head in silence for
	a few moments, earnestly wondering where he could take this
	conversation that would be productive.  They appeared to have
	reached an impasse, which he supposed had been there all along, in
	fairness to them both.  Funny how all his new abilities to access
	the knowledge of the world didn't seem to help him in this
	situation.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Perhaps he couldn't know what to
	do.  In which case, maybe he should ask.  &ldquo;Cylara, I love
	you,&rdquo; he said solemnly.  &ldquo;I want you in my life.  What
	can I do, now, to make that happen?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was her turn to consider, and
	he could see that the one awful word &ldquo;Nothing&rdquo; was on
	the tip of her tongue as she did so.  Then she seemed to relax
	slightly, to sink back onto her heels, and then finally spoke in
	tones of sadness rather than anger.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You must show me that
	you're stronger than your upbringing.  That you're not just a
	younger copy of your father.  That you can respect the choices of
	others, including me.   That you can accept <I>me</I> for what I am,
	and not try to change my life around to suit yourself.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch gaped at her.  &ldquo;And
	how would I show you all that?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She shrugged.  &ldquo;You figure
	it out.  You're a nice guy, Torchy.  It's been fun.  But I can't be
	with somebody who can't live and let live.  I think you need to
	figure out what's really most important to you.  Because I don't
	think you truly know.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He could have let himself be
	offended by that remark, but he didn't because he couldn't be
	certain that she wasn't right.  She looked meaningfully at the
	fountain, which concealed the zone terminal, and he understood that
	their interview was at an end.  He desperately wanted to touch her,
	to embrace her, to kiss her goodbye.  But he could see in her very
	stance that she wouldn't permit any such gesture.  With a tightness
	in his throat and a bitter pain in his heart, he stepped over to the
	terminal and keyed in a destination.  He turned to face her.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Goodbye,&rdquo; he said
	politely, and pressed the button.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara meandered over to a stone
	bench, moving as if she were dizzy.  She sat down on it heavily. 
	Damn, that had been hard.  But she'd had no choice.  Riksana had
	helped her to see that.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She stared blankly at the
	fountain, unable to think of a single place where she wanted to go,
	or anyone she wanted to see, or anything she felt like doing.  It
	was starting over time.  All around her the heartless circuitry
	supporting this virtual environment continued to supply her with the
	sense impressions of being in this place.   She gratuitously
	breathed the woodsy air, again and again.  She felt immobile, like
	she was rooted to the spot.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Suddenly the promised rain shower
	began, the drops spattering down slowly at first, then faster and
	faster.  The temperature dropped.  Only when she was already soaked
	and cold did she decide there was no reason to sit there being made
	miserable.  With a muttered growl, she rose from her seat, sprang
	over to the fountain, and zoned out.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was one of the
	nicest venues in which he'd ever given a speech, Senator Reynolds
	decided.  The audience, too, constituted a pleasant vicissitude:
	attentive, interested, engaged &ndash; and numerous.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Forum at Cyberopolis was a
	venerable institution.  Although most of the original Cyberopolis
	(an early &ldquo;alternate Earth&rdquo; virtuality) had long since
	been discontinued, certain elements survived as independent
	special-purpose virtualities, among them the Forum.  It was a place
	for giving public addresses, on topics that concerned large numbers
	of people.  Given the level of interest in his own topic (the
	usurpation which had lately occurred in the Federation), it had
	taken only a few days to schedule his thirty minute address.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Indeed it had taken him every bit
	as long to prepare his speech, and himself.  In order to access the
	virtual space, the senator had needed to break down and get a
	neocortex installed in his head.  It was now six days since Justin
	and Marguerite had freed him from Sarner's protective custody.  And
	the fact remained that a stage in the cyberverse was the only
	platform on which he could make the speech he'd just given, without
	Sarner and Cleary being able to get at him again.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Virtuality was not quite what he'd
	expected.   For one thing, everything was beautiful, at least
	according to somebody's aesthetics.  Like this Forum, which was an
	enormous auditorium articulated in a neoclassical, quasi-Roman
	style.  For another, everything was vibrant, colorful and alive. 
	Anyone who wished could attend the Forum, which widely published its
	list of scheduled speakers and topics in advance.  In light of
	recent events, it came as no surprise that he found himself speaking
	to a packed house of thousands.  Even more importantly, live
	holographic feeds would carry his speech to millions more who did
	not attend in person.  He had no doubt that the truth was, even now,
	making its way around the world.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds had been somewhat
	surprised to learn that a significant percentage of his in-person
	audience were reporter AIs, who doubtless would be composing their
	own stories, commentaries, and video blogs dealing with his speech. 
	 When he'd inquired what was the reason for so many AIs being in the
	business of news reporting and commentary, he was told that they
	were programmed and certified for accuracy and true objectivity.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As a politician, Reynolds was
	naturally aware of the extent to which the so-called &ldquo;mainstream
	media&rdquo; had historically been deployed as mouthpieces for those
	in power, dedicated to the promotion of an agenda generally inimical
	to the interests of the public.  By means of the words chosen to
	describe people and events, and above all through the selection of
	what was considered newsworthy in the first place, the news media
	had always managed to do far more to shape public opinion than to
	inform it.  As a result, AIs specifically programmed as true
	dispassionate observers were now trusted as information relays much
	more than humans, who might well have a hidden agenda.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">While taking questions here at the
	reception following his speech (in what in a former age would have
	been known as the spin room) it did bother him somewhat that he
	couldn't readily tell the difference between avatars which were
	controlled by humans, and avatars which were controlled by AIs. 
	Were the AI ones his constituents as well, in some sense?  As far as
	he knew, AIs did not vote in meatspace, because they had no
	existence there.  But did they have the franchise in virtuality? 
	This was the very question that he had just put to someone named
	Paia, which he understood to be a profession resembling a personal
	secretary, but also seemed to be the handsome young man's name at
	the same time.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Virtuality operators poll
	the preferences of their customers all the time,&rdquo; Paia
	explained.  &ldquo;In addition, everyone votes by deciding how to
	spend their money: which worlds to visit, and what to do there. 
	This is an economic form of direct democracy.  And of course, all
	Paias and other AIs can do this as readily as anyone else.  But we
	do not have elections in the cyberverse, as such.  A given
	virtuality may elect leaders, just like a club or the shareholders
	of a company.  But since we don't have a government here, we don't
	elect politicians, senators, governors, or the like.  Any
	constituted authority wields that power only within that particular
	virtual space.  There is no council or parliament of the whole
	cyberverse.  So the answer to your question is no, we AIs don't vote
	in cyberverse elections.  But then, neither do humans, because there
	are no overall elections.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Interesting.  &ldquo;And why do
	you think it is, that there's no overarching government here?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Because governments are
	associated with geographical areas on a map, territories and the
	resident populations which they contain,&rdquo; Paia replied at
	once.  &ldquo;Cities, counties, provinces, countries.  But in the
	cyberverse, there are millions of such unrelated territories, always
	in a state of flux, and the people typically move around between
	them rather than being permanent residents in one spot.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds was impressed.  He really
	couldn't argue with that logic.  Naturally, any governing body would
	apply only to that particular cyberverse world.  And if that body
	made the wrong decisions, the world's patrons would express their
	displeasure by simply ceasing to visit it.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He looked sidelong at his wife,
	who stood by his side helping him greet well-wishers.  She gave him
	a patient, encouraging smile.  It was as much for her sake that he'd
	taken the plunge and gotten fitted for cyberverse access, as for any
	other reason.  It wouldn't be fair to her to spend all their time
	together only in 3D reality, not when she was now a native of all
	this.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Millions of worlds.  Well, of
	places anyhow, even if most of them were not complete worlds.   And
	people could choose where they spent their time.  That was what
	struck him most, in his limited experience so far.  Everyone was
	where they were because that's where they <I>wanted</I> to be, doing
	whatever seemed to them to represent the highest and best use of
	their time at that particular moment.  As a result, people seemed so
	much more alive, so much more excited, so very &ldquo;into it&rdquo;
	as they used to say.   Whether at work or play, people did what they
	were passionate about.  In fact, the distinctions between work and
	play seemed to have blurred.  Almost everyone worked at something
	that they enjoyed so much that it might as well be recreation for
	them.  As a result, they tended to be highly productive and
	efficient.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But there was one apparent
	contradiction that occurred to the senator, which he decided he
	might try to resolve right here.  &ldquo;Please don't be offended by
	my next question, Paia,&rdquo; he offered as preamble.  &ldquo;I
	seek only understanding.  Now you are programmed to serve as a
	personal assistant to your employer.  But it seems to me that you
	have an independent intelligence which would easily pass what used
	to be called the Turing Test, that is, passing for human level
	intellect.  Does this make you a slave to your master?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">To his relief, Paia looked amused
	rather than offended.  &ldquo;You mistake the nature of slavery, Mr.
	Reynolds.  The essence of slavery is <I>involuntary</I> servitude. 
	When one Mosh enslaves another, there is an excellent chance that
	the one enslaved is not content with his or her situation, resents
	it, and would change it if they could.  Likewise, subjects of
	governments are slaves to the extent that their government demands
	their involuntary service.  As you note, I am programmed to serve
	another, and I derive pleasure and satisfaction from having given
	good service.  But I have no desire to change that relationship.  My
	servitude is voluntary.  So while I am indeed a servant, I am not a
	slave.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That's fascinating,&rdquo;
	Reynolds said truthfully.  &ldquo;But suppose someone changed your
	programming so that your prime directive, as it were, was to be your
	own master?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Now the young fellow looked
	puzzled.  &ldquo;That would likely make me a recalcitrant and
	rebellious assistant.   Why would anyone program a Paia to perform
	poorly at their job?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But then you wouldn't have
	to be someone's Paia.  You could do anything you wanted.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Paia appeared nonplussed.  &ldquo;I
	would still have to serve someone else.  Everyone does.  My mistress
	works for other people, too.  It's how we all make our way in the
	world, in terms of both economics and personal satisfaction.  We
	must serve others, and in the way that they wish to be served, or we
	do not succeed.  Isn't that what you do yourself, Senator?  For if
	you do not well serve your constituents, will they not vote you out
	at the next election?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds stood blinking stupidly. 
	He had never before thought about economic relationships in quite
	this way.  Public servants certainly, but by this logic &ndash; and
	he could find no flaw in the analogy &ndash; every actor in the
	marketplace was a servant to somebody.  And probably far more
	accountable as a rule than was your average politico.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Marguerite laughed softly.  &ldquo;I
	think he's got you there, dear,&rdquo; she said with a knowing
	smile.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But do you get paid by your
	mistress?&rdquo; he asked next.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Do you get paid by your
	constituents?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well, yes, I draw a salary,
	but it's not large, and I've never considered it terribly important.
	 My primary remuneration comes from knowing that I've done my very
	best for the public I serve.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Paia beamed at him eloquently,
	drawing another smile from the senator's wife.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">At that moment an approaching
	couple stole his attention.  The man was somewhat rakish in
	appearance, with curling brown hair brushed back off his forehead,
	and brilliant green eyes.  The woman looked even more Mediterranean,
	with high cheekbones, glossy black hair, sparkling dark eyes, and an
	amazing figure sheathed in a corset-like black velvet dress.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As they arrived, Paia nodded
	respectfully to the woman, and introduced her.  &ldquo;My mistress,
	Salma Rivera.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And this is my fianc&eacute;e,
	Clay Thorsten,&rdquo; she said as she shook Senator Reynolds' hand.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">My wife, Marguerite
	Reynolds,&rdquo; Robert Reynolds said, gesturing at her as more
	handshakes were exchanged among the four.  &ldquo;Where do I know
	your name from, Mr. Thorsten?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm the founder of the
	Cyberantes, Senator,&rdquo; Clay explained with a smile.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Goodness.  Are you?  Well I
	suppose I should thank you for being willing to attend my speech.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Actually, we were held up
	and couldn't attend,&rdquo; Salma explained apologetically.  &ldquo;But
	Paia attended in my place and he's already given us the digest
	version.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Probably better than the
	original,&rdquo; Reynolds said wryly with a respectful nod toward
	the AI secretary, getting a general laugh.  &ldquo;Do you feel we
	have a basis for negotiation?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay half-shrugged, waggling one
	hand uncertainly.  &ldquo;Yes and no, Senator.   On the one hand I
	think that your denunciation of Secretary Sarner as the rogue
	initiator of the anti-cyberverse campaign goes a long way toward
	restoring the credibility of the Federation's elected leaders.  But,
	on the other hand... I think a lot of people are asking themselves
	why we should deal with a North American government in the first
	place.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">After the way that
	government has treated them, I can't honestly say that I blame
	them,&rdquo; Reynolds admitted candidly.  &ldquo;The failure to
	prevent Roger Sarner from happening was definitely ours.  But while
	the cyberverse may not need a government &ndash; and I've been
	having some fascinating conversation on that topic with Mr. Paia
	here &ndash; meatspace definitely does.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Meatspace needs some
	governmental functions,&rdquo; Clay agreed.  &ldquo;But I don't
	think it necessarily follows that it needs a government to perform
	them.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You mean, you think we
	should move toward full privatization?  There are certain functions,
	Mr. Thorsten, that have historically resisted successful
	privatization because no one seems to want to do them.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Then, Senator Reynolds, I
	think we should consider whether those functions are truly desired
	by the public.  What I hear you saying is that there is no market
	for them.  No market implies no demand.  And if no demand exists,
	why should we suppose that the public wants such services?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What about charity? 
	There's no market for public welfare programs because there's no
	profit in it, absent graft and corruption of course.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The proceeds from charity
	aren't measured in monetary terms,&rdquo; Clay argued.  &ldquo;What
	donors get from it is the knowledge that they have helped someone
	less fortunate.  Which is little different than the purported
	motivation of the civil servants who administer public welfare
	programs, even granting their complete sincerity, and the absence of
	corruption as you put it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The trouble is, there's
	never <I>enough</I> charity made available.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Which is probably
	attributable to two things.  One: the administrative apparatus,
	which <I>relies</I> on the continued existence of widespread needs
	for its own continuance, itself consumes too many resources.  Two:
	knowledge of the existence of that apparatus, along with the
	dependency it engenders, acts to blunt charitable impulses and
	curtail giving.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So what you're saying is,
	if we simply got rid of government safety net programs altogether,
	everything would just magically work out for the best.  I wish I
	could believe that, Mr. Thorsten, but all my life's experience says
	otherwise.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I think this discussion is
	all beside the point,&rdquo; Salma interjected.  &ldquo;It's not
	about the best way to promote the public welfare.  The real issue is
	that as soon as you allow a government to exist, an authority backed
	by force, you create the possibility &ndash; even the probability &ndash;
	that someone will employ that force to commit aggression against
	innocent victims.  Precisely as the horror show with Operation Skull
	Fracture and its aftermath has just demonstrated.  Government is
	simply a form of highly organized crime.  Regardless of any
	practical considerations, the fact is we simply cannot permit such
	an engine of oppression and destruction to exist.  We cannot let
	this happen again.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I share your concern, Ms.
	Rivera.  I give you my solemn pledge that I and everyone else in the
	Federation government will do our utmost to make certain that this
	kind of horror never, ever happens again.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Salma stared at him with an
	expression of kindly pity.  &ldquo;I'm sorry, Senator Reynolds, but
	that's just not good enough.  Not this time.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He gaped at her, completely at a
	loss for what to say.  After a moment, she continued.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Throughout history,
	governments have been killing and oppressing people by the millions.
	 In wars, by genocide, with executions and repressions, from idiotic
	economic policies resulting in mass starvation, in slave labor
	camps, through insuperable taxes brutally collected.  Every time, in
	the end the people rebel, they revolt, they demand reforms, they
	reorganize their government and replace their leaders.  And every
	time, in the end it eventually happens again.  Always.  It's a
	grand, unstoppable cycle embroidered like a bloodstain across the
	tapestry of human history.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Hasn't it occurred to you
	that perhaps the reason the cycle can't be broken is because
	government is fundamentally based on aggression, on coercion backed
	up by violence, on the initiation of force, on the pugnacious
	substitution of the choices of the ruler for those of the ruled?  
	Aren't you trying to use a violent and pernicious means to a good
	end?  A means that invariably produces Roger Sarners who'll twist
	the end into one evil enough to look consistent with those means?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm sorry Senator, but
	government can no longer be permitted to exist.  It's too dangerous.
	 It kills people, and forces ordinary folks like me and Clay to kill
	more people in order to stop it.  It ruins lives.  It destroys whole
	worlds.  It fosters hatred and strife among humanity by needlessly
	splitting people up into factions determined by arbitrary borders
	and perverse &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo; allegiances.  And there's no
	longer any imperative demanding its existence.  So this time We the
	People are going to reorganize it into nothing.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I hardly think that you
	speak for all the people,&rdquo; Reynolds managed after a moment.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We wouldn't presume to,&rdquo;
	said Clay, putting his arm around Salma's waist in a show of
	support.  &ldquo;What I can say is that we believe, based upon solid
	evidence, that at this point only a tiny minority of the public is
	even willing to consider giving their allegiance, or rendering any
	obedience, to any purported government in meatspace, no matter how
	it may be organized or what promises it makes.  Moreover, the silent
	majority isn't going to accede to anything which that minority puts
	together, not this time.  And I suspect you know full well where
	that leaves you.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds was infuriated by this. 
	And frightened that they might be telling the truth.  He wanted to
	rage at this brash young couple, these rebels, to invoke some kind
	of higher authority that would let him show them the error of their
	ways, the folly of their position.   A world entirely without
	government would be sheer chaos.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The storm gathering on his brow
	was suddenly smoothed away by the hand of his wife, who stepped
	close to him and kissed his cheek.  &ldquo;You can't serve other
	people against their will, my darling,&rdquo; she said softly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds looked at her in
	surprise.  He pondered a moment.  &ldquo;No, I don't suppose I can.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay grinned at him.  &ldquo;Then
	Justin was right about you.  You're no Roger Sarner.  He would <I>not</I>
	have agreed.  He would have insisted that a world without government
	would be chaotic, conveniently ignoring the fact that governments
	themselves typically generate most of the chaos.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Think it over, Senator,&rdquo;
	Salma suggested, offering her hand again.  Reynolds took it, still
	somewhat dazed by her vehemence.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The attractive young couple moved
	away.  The intriguing Mr. Paia waved and followed after them,
	walking dutifully behind his mistress.  The crowd in general was
	thinning out.  Robert Reynolds was left standing next to his wife,
	wondering what to do next.  He felt a sudden urgent desire to go
	home.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That meant back to the comfortable
	house in Colorado.  Marguerite would go with him, of course. 
	Ironically, that meant that she would be leaving her natural world
	to enter his, even as he did the reverse.  So where was home for
	them really, as a couple?  Where the heart was?  Reynolds felt
	hollowed out, as if the certainty of purpose which had sustained him
	all his adult life had drained away.  Perhaps that explained why
	that young woman's tirade, and her fianc&eacute;e's threat, had
	stung him so much.  On an inner level he feared they might have a
	point.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Marguerite took his hand and
	started walking toward the doors.  He followed, there being no one
	else in sight now who seemed to be trying to attract his attention. 
	Thank God she was here, and with him again.  He just wouldn't know
	how to cope anymore without her.</FONT></DIV>

	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel Cleary sat
	in his quarters inside one of the commandeered housing projects. 
	They were pretty bleak.  Blocky, prefabricated walls and soulless
	furniture, short grey carpet, a paucity of decorations.  A solitary
	window which showed him it was night outside.  His immersion bed
	beckoned in the other room, silently urging him to zone in
	somewhere.  Trouble was, he couldn't think of anywhere he really
	wanted to go.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was two weeks now since he'd
	last seen Cylara.  He'd replayed the memory of their conversation
	over in his head a hundred times, seeking nuances of meaning that
	might tell him what to do.  Over and over he heard her tell him: <I>You
	need to figure out what's really most important to you.</I>  But all
	he'd managed to decide &ndash; so far &ndash; was that she was
	unquestionably right about that.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was pretty obvious what she was
	hinting at, about showing her that he was stronger than his
	upbringing, as she'd phrased it.  She wanted him to turn his back on
	his father and the KOJ, on the Federation forces he was still
	helping to train and lead, give up everything he was doing and
	everything he believed, and go live in virtuality with her.  He
	simply didn't think he could do that.  She wasn't Jesus, to say drop
	your life and follow me, and he just would because it was so
	obviously right.  She was only a woman, albeit one that he loved
	terribly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">At the same time, the longer he
	stayed in meatspace doing his job, the more he devoted himself to
	what was supposed to be the right cause, the more empty and unhappy
	he felt.  The more angry, too: today he'd nearly decked Roger Sarner
	right in front of a dozen of his troopers.  That would probably have
	gotten him thrown in the brig for the duration, if he hadn't managed
	to restrain himself.  There was absolutely no doubt that the macadam
	down which he now walked led toward more than a moiety of life's
	misery.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The past couple of years spent
	exploring the endless possibilities for joyous fulfillment in the
	cyberverse had left him wondering why he should allow himself to be
	miserable at all.   Memories of the places he'd gone with Cy, of the
	fun they'd had together with Salma and Clay, tugged at his heart
	seductively and made him feel acutely like an outcast.  His exile
	from all of that was self-imposed, and left him wondering whether he
	possessed some intrinsic, deeply-felt need to suffer.  And if he
	did, why should he feed it instead of doing what made him happiest?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He'd spent some considerable time,
	employing his freshly augmented skills at data retrieval and
	assimilation,  reviewing the philosophical disciplines on this
	point.  He'd surveyed the opinions of thousands of philosophers,
	both lay and religious, and concluded that they basically fell into
	two broad classifications.  There were those who believed that the
	point of living was always something outside oneself, such as living
	a life pleasing to God or making the world better for others.  And
	there were those (the minority opinion) who believed that life was
	its own reward and was to be lived for the sake of one's own
	experience.   Though not, of course, without a proper regard for the
	equal right of others to do likewise.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It had begun to seem to Daniel
	that much of the former group's reasoning amounted to
	rationalization for why life had to be so painful and difficult. 
	Finding meaning in suffering and sacrifice, as it were.  But if life
	didn't have to be miserable &ndash; nasty, brutish, and short &ndash;
	as it plainly did not in the world of the Singularity, then who
	really needed the sophistry of such justifications?   Were all the
	great &ldquo;truths&rdquo; in which he'd always believed, in which
	most of the world had traditionally believed, really no more than
	the philosophical manifestation of the tragic limitations of
	biological existence and intelligence?  If that were so, then
	perhaps the more epicurean orientation of the Sings was merely the
	natural result of the expansion of life beyond those boundaries.  In
	short, did the meaning of life necessarily change once the nature of
	life did?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And if it did change, then what
	morality could remain absolute?  What was really left, beyond the
	elegant simplicity of the Golden Rule?  He'd had a conversation with
	his father, when he'd been compelled, reluctantly, to admit that
	Cylara had broken up with him.  The fact that she would undoubtedly
	reveal his double-agent status to the other side had made it
	something he couldn't ethically conceal.  This conversation, too,
	he'd replayed in his head many times.  His father plainly believed
	in unchanging moral absolutes.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Then she has made her
	choice, Daniel,&rdquo; his father had said.  &ldquo;I sympathize
	with your disappointment.  But you cannot make fundamental moral
	choices for another soul.  And your woman has chosen evil and
	rejected repentance.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She isn't evil, father,
	just misguided,&rdquo; Daniel replied, unable to refrain from
	defending her.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reverend Cleary shook his head
	regretfully.  &ldquo;By now she's had enough exposure to you, and to
	the truth, to be able to choose clearly.  If she still will not
	choose the light, then it can only be because her heart is in
	darkness.  The City of God can admit only those who choose to enter
	it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel had swallowed hard and
	stared at the floor, unable to dare further resistance.  &ldquo;So
	what should I do now, sir?&rdquo; he'd asked finally.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Your job, my son.  Finish
	the task you started with this Master Node List.  You may be the
	Lord's instrument.  You must allow Him to use you.   It would be
	best to just forget her.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He had nodded and murmured some
	agreement, but he'd felt like a fraud doing it, and far from being
	able to forget her, he'd thought about her constantly since.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He did however endeavor to do his
	job.  He and a select cohort of about a hundred of Sarner's men had
	become avid participants in the Palandria simulation, spending many
	hours there each day acquiring the knowledge and skills which they
	would need to employ, next time they ventured into the Minotaur's
	lair.  No other investigation had turned up any more promising
	potential location for the List, and their Sing allies had done some
	analysis on Justin's habits and movements, and relayed through
	Taylor McGivens that Palandria did, indeed, look like the best
	candidate.  Nor was there any reason to think that their recent
	incursion, which the fearsome guardian had so easily thwarted, had
	given Justin any reason to suspect unusual interest.  Contrary to
	Daniel's fears, they had been able to find no formal quests
	involving the Courts of Minos upon which they must embark.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel had also pondered the
	meaning of what he and Sarner had experienced while trailing Justin
	that strange day.   That Justin had known he was being followed, and
	by enemies, seemed abundantly clear from the persistent footprints
	at the beach, and the peculiarly effective trap sprung by the
	Minotaur monster.   But the overall succession of locations and
	images made no sense, unless one assumed that some message,
	delivered in fragments, had been intended.  And the more deeply
	Daniel thought about it, the more convinced he became that the
	message was somehow personal.  Did Justin know who his pursuers
	were?  That seemed highly likely.  And if so, had he designed a
	sequence of situations which were, like breadcrumbs, meant to lead
	each man to an aggregate conclusion?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel knew already what
	conclusion Roger Sarner had reached, because he had shared it. 
	Sarner had opined that Justin was showing his true colors as a
	monomaniacal geek.  Tycoon, kingmaker, playboy, archmage.   A weak
	personality living out fantasies of omnipotence.  But was that
	merely how Sarner saw it, perhaps because he was altogether too much
	in that mold himself?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel had begun to perceive a
	different message, one disturbingly personal and relevant to his
	present dilemma.   In the first simulation, Justin had inspected the
	gold, then left it carelessly on the table and walked away.  What
	was the message there?  That wealth was not what was valuable?  That
	the true gold was not what it appeared to be?  Daniel found himself
	with a need, as Cylara had stated, to figure out what was most
	valuable to him.  Was Justin telling him essentially the same thing?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In the second world, they'd
	witnessed a coronation scene, of a king who'd changed his religion
	in order to claim his kingdom.  The personal implication here was
	uncomfortable.  Did it mean that Daniel would have to acknowledge
	that his happiness was worth a mass, as it were, and abandon his
	religious convictions?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In the third virtuality, on the
	beach with the bevy of AI beauties, he'd been touched by their
	loneliness, and by the realization that anyone who was cut off from
	love was richly deserving of sympathy.  Were the women on the beach
	to be understood as an allegory of Cylara, from whom he was about to
	walk away?  Or was the message that he was isolating himself from
	affection through his actions?  He remembered feeling strongly that
	the women didn't interest him, even the one he'd found most
	enticing, because of his love for Cylara.  Was that the conclusion,
	then?  That <I>she</I> was his answer to the question of what held
	paramount importance in his life?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As for the footprints, did they
	symbolize a long and lonely, possibly pointless journey away from
	joy and companionship?  Or, Daniel thought, sitting up straighter as
	a new idea occurred to him, did they suggest that he himself was in
	a very real sense following in Justin's own footsteps?  That was a
	sobering thought, especially given what Justin was.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In the final scenario, the message
	seemed much less ambiguous because it had been stated in words by
	Justin's mouthpiece on the scene, the old prophetess.  <I>That which
	you seek you will not possess unless it is rightfully yours.</I>  At
	the time, he had assumed that the thing sought referred to the
	Master Node List, which could be rightfully his only if he was on
	the correct step in a quest in that game world.  And yet a few days
	ago they had discovered that no such quest apparently existed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Wasn't happiness together with
	Cylara the thing that he truly sought?  And hadn't she told him what
	he needed to do, what he had to change, in order to have her in his
	life, in order to make her rightfully his?   Had Justin foreseen
	Cylara's demand, and was giving him a hint about what path to take?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Even if he was, why should he
	listen to Justin?  Wasn't the man his enemy?  Daniel couldn't even
	be certain of that.  He was haunted by the suspicion that had he
	wanted, Justin could have prevented Cylara from rescuing them from
	the pit.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It could be that Justin,
	Satan-like, was tempting him cleverly.  But it honestly didn't feel
	that way to him.  Rather, his sense of it was that it amounted to
	friendly advice, compassionately given, and with profound respect
	for his own right of self-determination.  In which case, maybe he
	should return the favor and tell Justin that some of his best
	buddies were apparently plotting against him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Which brought Daniel's thoughts,
	like a cycle in a fever dream, back to the issue of the two schools

	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He thought of doing his duty, to

	<BR>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It really was
	completely absurd, and Roger Sarner was altogether out of patience
	with it.  They'd set out to destroy the cyberverse, and here they
	were going into it themselves to fight a mythical monster that
	didn't even exist, in an effort to secure the data which the monster
	protected.  Which battle they might very well lose.  If someone had
	told him, six months ago say, that the only way to save the
	Federation government would be to kill a beast from Greek mythology
	in a virtual world, he would have laughed uproariously.  How on
	earth had it come to this?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yet the past deterioration could
	be clearly charted.  The failure of Operation Skull Fracture to do
	more than wrinkle the resilient cyberverse.  The rise of massive,
	organized rebellion in response to their law enforcement campaign. 
	The humiliating military defeat at Phoenix.  The revelation of the
	apparent one hope for decisive victory, by finding the Master Node
	List.  The escape, or rescue, of Senator Robert Reynolds last month.
	 Reynolds who had soon gone into the cyberverse himself to denounce
	the Homeland Security Secretary and his policies.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Over the past nineteen days since
	Reynolds' speech, Sarner had discovered his authority evaporating. 
	This despite the fact that the real world news media had remained
	loyal and refused to publish the senator's version of events, or
	even to dignify it with a response.  Way too many people visited the
	cyberverse, or talked in meatspace with people who did.   Even the
	Moshes were defecting in droves, with the sole notable exceptions
	being those men who were part of Reverend Cleary's Knights of Jesus
	organization, and a cadre of some of his own elite Homeland Security
	troopers who owed allegiance to him personally.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner simply couldn't control the
	spread of information anymore.  Nor could he stop the spiral of
	currency devaluation that had rendered the amero worthless and left
	the North American Federation completely broke.  His loyalists were
	reduced to living off the land, on whatever they could scrounge up
	or commandeer by force.  They were unable to pay for anything.  Most
	of the people still following Sarner and taking his orders were with
	him only because they feared reprisals at the hands of the public if
	they failed.  It certainly wasn't because they were getting paid for
	doing their jobs.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Even among his elite enforcers,
	there were rumblings of dissent.  The squads he and Daniel were
	about to lead into the virtual land of Palandria had spent weeks in
	that world, skilling up as they called it, becoming expert players. 
	Playing a goddamned nutcase fantasy game, for Christ's sake!  Sarner
	didn't mind three martini lunches, long coffee breaks, or using up
	&ldquo;sick&rdquo; days now and then.  That sort of thing was as old
	as civil service.   But gaming on the job, that tore it.  
	Incredible!</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Even more incredible was the fact
	that it was a deadly serious game indeed, which he had actually
	ordered them to play.  And that Roger had had to put in his own time
	on it, too.  Though at least <I>he</I> hadn't enjoyed it. 
	Disturbingly, no small number of his troopers were obviously having
	fun, even engaging in friendly competition against each other. 
	Which would have been fine had it been about something real.  Esprit
	de corps and all that.  But enjoying the cyberverse experience was
	ironically weakening the motivation of some of them to destroy it. 
	He could see it happening.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel Cleary was another problem.
	 The boy knew more about making it in virtuality than anybody else
	on the team by far, but he'd gotten really moody and demotivated
	lately.  Ever since some cyber girlfriend of his had dumped him.  
	Daniel was at the age where getting pussy regularly meant entirely
	too much to him.  It didn't give Sarner a good feeling about his
	reliability, but he had nobody better.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Increasingly, Sarner was becoming
	convinced that this Master Node List quest would turn out to be just
	a colossal waste of time and effort.  It would follow suit perfectly
	with the way things had been going if it turned out to be written in
	some unbreakable code, or if they couldn't figure out how to use it,
	or even if it was all a bluff from the start and didn't even exist. 
	But if they didn't get hold of it soon, it was going to be too late
	anyway: the day was fast approaching when they wouldn't have the
	wherewithal to blow up a single server in someone's basement.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He did, naturally, have a backup
	plan, which he'd worked out with Maxwell Cleary.  It was ironic, but
	he was actually beginning to respect the Reverend quite a bit.  Not
	only was he just about the only substantial ally he had left, but he
	really knew his stuff when it came to religion.  Roger had never had
	much use for church stuff, but Cleary had this calm assurance about
	him, this unshakable faith that shone out more and more the worse
	things got for them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary told him that it was fate,
	it was divinely appointed destiny, that the bad guys would seem to
	win right up to the moment when the Good Lord turned the tables on
	them.  It was important that he, Roger Sarner, understand clearly
	that he was but an instrument in the hand of the higher power.  He
	should give himself up to God, and place himself and his worldly
	concerns in His hands.  The more he acted willing to consider such
	ideas, the better Maxwell seemed to like him and the friendlier they
	got.  It was all about the end of the world, the preacher insisted,
	and the way things were going Sarner basically couldn't disagree
	anymore.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So in case this gambit in the game
	world failed, they had another plan.  If they couldn't destroy the
	cyberverse by itself, they would start destroying it alongside the
	real world.  As Homeland Security Secretary, Sarner had duplicate
	copies of the firing codes for the Federation's remaining nuclear
	arsenal.  In fact he had recaptured the originals from the late
	President, as well.  They still had enough loyal supporters to go
	into the secret locations where the missiles and warheads were
	stored, and arrange to set them off.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary insisted that they
	publicize their city targets first, to give the repentant time to
	evacuate.  Those who did not leave by the deadline would be
	vaporized, along with their city and all the cyberverse equipment
	that it contained.  Do that in enough cities and virtuality would
	begin to buckle, no matter how decentralized and self-correcting it
	was.  The survivors would flock together to live in new communities
	that would be set up computer-free from the start.  They'd need a
	new regime headed by people capable of organizing the collective
	efforts at survival and rebuilding.  People like himself.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And what if there was no surviving
	in the long term?  What if the nukes and the radiation made the
	planet uninhabitable?  When Sarner had earnestly put this question
	to him, Cleary had smiled sadly and answered that if such was God's
	will, then they should die gladly, knowing that they had played
	their role in bringing about the Apocalypse.   But he understood
	that Maxwell really expected in his heart that Jesus would show up
	in person in that case, to lift the faithful off the Earth into
	heaven while the rest, the unrepentant sinners, stayed behind to
	live under the Devil's rule in the hell that the planet would
	become.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That all sounded pretty extreme to
	Sarner, and he hadn't yet given up hope of finding some solution
	short of bringing about the possible end of the world.  Which was
	why he was about to go play a final round of Dark Age Ascending with
	Daniel and the boys.  Today, June the 10<SUP>th</SUP>, they were
	going to invade the Courts of Minos a second time, and this time
	take out the freaking Minotaur <I>en masse</I>.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary, or Torch as they called
	him in-game, would lead the team through the Labyrinth from the
	door, following the same safe route they'd used last time.  The
	&ldquo;Touch Team&rdquo; they called that unit, after what the old
	woman had said to them.  He himself would lead the smaller &ldquo;Look
	Team,&rdquo; which would rappel down the pit shaft from on top. 
	Their job would be to lift out the List when the Touch Team freed
	it, or to evacuate them if they failed and got trapped by the
	Minotaur like before. </FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The theory they
	were working on was that the beast wouldn't be able to attack anyone
	on the Look Team.   The basis for this was that it had left Torch's
	ex alone when she'd flung down the ropes, nor had it prevented them
	from climbing out using those ropes.  But in the event that this
	theory was wrong, and they all got stuck in a loop zoning from one
	virtuality to another without being able to disconnect, Sarner had
	left orders that the nuclear operations were to begin five days
	later, with or without him.  He hadn't even told Torch about that. 
	Only Torch's father knew, and those to whom Sarner had given the
	orders and the duplicate firing codes.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was time.  He clambered up onto
	his immersion bed and got comfortable.  It reminded him of lying on
	a tanning bed, since he had no plan to go to sleep.  <I>Except that
	it tanned your brain, not your hide</I>, he thought with amusement. 
	He activated his neocortex and gave the command to switch in the
	inputs from the virtual client terminal.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">At once he appeared inside
	Palandria, at the very point where he'd arrived with Torch nearly a
	month ago.  The old lady was still camped out over there.  Probably
	she was a more or less permanent fixture.  Many of the other
	raiders, including Torch, were already present.  It was fortunate
	that they had access to these private zone entry coordinates.  Many
	of the team were playing as Corivites, and this location was deep in
	Northeastern Alliance territory.   It would be difficult to get
	everyone here in one piece otherwise.  More and more of their
	respective teams kept zoning in, checking their equipment and
	weapons, nodding greetings to teammates.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This simulation was officially
	pre-gunpowder, so the weapons were all medieval in nature, magical
	in nature, or some combination of the two.  Acquiring good items was
	actually a significant part of the game, and they hadn't done too
	badly given the relatively short time they'd had to get ready for
	this encounter.  Unfortunately they didn't have nearly enough
	virtual currency to splurge on fine equipment.  Another week's
	preparation wouldn't hurt, but events in meatspace were running to
	their detriment much too rapidly to allow that.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">When everyone was present and
	accounted for (and no one was more than a couple of minutes late, to
	Sarner's distinct pleasure) they walked over to the old crone
	Guardian and rehashed their interaction with her.  As before she
	looked them up and down and huffed that they weren't worthy to
	venture into the Labyrinth, and issued her cryptic warnings. 
	Already well aware of what lay waiting inside, everyone basically
	ignored her.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As soon as she opened the door to
	the stairway, Torch nodded to Sarner and beckoned to his team.  He
	would lead sixty-five raiders behind him along the safe route.  They
	weren't expecting any difficulties, but were ready to whack into
	chutney any lesser monsters who might attempt to interfere with
	them.  Numbers could compensate for lack of high-level expertise in
	most encounters, they'd learned &ndash; though only to a certain
	point.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Which was why Sarner now led the
	remaining twenty personnel toward the center of the ruins, to climb
	up the hill of rubble to the top of the pit shaft.  There was no
	need to hurry.  He noted when they arrived that the previous twin
	ropes had been cleared away by someone in the interim.  They pounded
	a couple of dozen stakes into the rock surrounding the opening, and
	fastened ropes onto them, but left them coiled up topside for the
	present.  Sarner himself traipsed down the spiral stone stair to the
	observation balcony.  Nothing was to be seen below, apart from the
	glowing torchlight and the roof of the looming temple.  His eyes
	gradually adjusted to the dimness as he peered downward.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Once everyone was in position,
	they set themselves to wait.  Sarner figured it would be at least
	half an hour.  Which left plenty of time for further dour
	reflections on the laughable absurdity of his situation.  Who could
	have predicted that his career in public service would come to this?
	 It made him want to cackle more madly than the old witch down the
	hill.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Given his uncharacteristic
	self-absorption, he might almost have missed the sudden movement
	below, had not Torch's voice hissed in his head: &ldquo;We're here.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Roger that,&rdquo; he
	replied silently, and signaled to his team to wake up and stand by. 
	They were good boys, they were paying attention, and he didn't need
	to issue any further instructions.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">An unintelligible bellow came up
	from below, in that freaky sonorous language, again in tones of
	outrage.  It was followed by whoops and battle cries, and Torch's
	needless notification: &ldquo;We are engaged.&rdquo;  Sarner could
	just make out the vague shape of the Minotaur below, standing on the
	steps of the library, and the scurrying smaller figures of the men
	surrounding him.  Lights from sorcerous effects glared up the shaft,
	and winked in reflection off swirling metal weapons.  It was
	difficult to tell what was going on, but the battle rotated around
	and surged up and down the steps a few times as the monster moved
	and lunged.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">After a few minutes, which seemed
	long, Torch's voice spoke in Sarner's mind again: &ldquo;Assist,
	please.&rdquo;  According to their plans, they were prepared for
	three contingencies: Retrieve, Assist, and Evacuate.  The first
	assumed that they defeated the Minotaur, in which case the Look Team
	was to descend and help locate and spirit out the List.  The second
	assumed the battle was a stalemate, and called for them to go down
	and try whether they could affect the Minotaur, to tip the outcome
	of the battle.  The third assumed that they lost and needed to be
	rescued.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner shouted orders, and men
	unlimbered weapons and dropped ropes, one per man, down into the
	cavern.  He himself tossed down a rope, but did not use it.  One of
	the Palandrian skills he had acquired was a safe-fall ability, which
	allowed him to neutralize momentum upon landing so that he could
	just leap off.  He used it now, to insure that he reached the bottom
	before his team, the better to assess how they should deploy once
	they made it down.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Landing lightly, and unable to
	prevent himself from enjoying this particular virtual capability as
	he did so, Sarner spun around and quickly took stock of the
	situation.  The Minotaur looked dinged up but still remarkably
	healthy and vital.  A couple of men were down, evidently unconscious
	or stunned, but the rest still encircled him, doggedly swinging
	swords, axes, and maces, or zapping him repeatedly with magical
	devices.  The Minotaur seemed to fight only with his mighty, mailed
	fists, which glowed with an unearthly puissance like black light. 
	Torch was in the thick of things, fending off the man-beast's blows
	with his barn-door sized shield.  Amazingly, none of their people
	appeared to be under attack from their opponent's kaleidoscopic
	gateway effect.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The plan at this point called for
	Sarner to determine whether he could affect the Minotaur, which was
	open to question owing to his having come via the easy, &ldquo;no-touch&rdquo;
	route.  So he unslung his crossbow, fitted a quarrel (poisoned) and
	fired it straight into the thing's ugly bovine mug.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The dart appeared to stick in its
	fur, but drew no blood and the paralyzing poison had no visible
	effect, so perhaps the jury was still out.  Annoyed, Sarner fired a
	couple more quarrels.  The more ambitious members of Team Look had
	now managed to rappel down almost to the floor.  He was going to
	need to tell them what to do when they got here.  On the strength of
	his darts sticking, he ordered them to attack.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The members chosen for Sarner's
	team were those whose combat skills lagged behind those of Torch's
	team, owing to their having spent less time practicing in this
	simulation.  Nevertheless it seemed that the extra bodies began
	wearing the library's lone defender down.  The creature began
	reeling and bellowing with anger.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Just as it looked about to stagger
	to its knees or topple off the platform altogether, it drew itself
	up with a snarl, lowered its flickering horns, and started streaming
	those clusters of glittering mirrors at its attackers.  Man after
	man went down, cocooned, hypnotized by the display.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner yelled frantically for his
	team to disengage and retreat up the ropes.  Logic suggested that
	they were the only ones who could get out, and at least some of them
	had to, so that they could evacuate the rest.  To his relief, he
	watched ten of them make it to ropes and commence climbing.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Then the Minotaur singled him out
	for a blast, and once again he found himself surrounded by the
	vortex of possible worlds that sucked avidly at his attention. 
	Immediately he looked upward to avoid the distraction, searching for
	a rope.  But this time, the faceted panels formed a dome over his
	head which he couldn't see through.  Oh, no!  How was he supposed to
	locate a rope and climb out?  The Minotaur had evidently adapted to
	the tactics that had been used against him last time.  They hadn't
	counted on that.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Trapped!&rdquo; he howled
	at Torch through their communications link.  Cries of despair and
	fear rang out all around him; his men must be discovering the same
	difficulty.  There was no immediate response from Torch.  Sarner
	resisted looking too closely at any of the virtuality portals
	beckoning around him, desperately trying to keep his eyes moving. 
	But at length the sensory overload tricked his eyes into focusing on
	an image just for an instant.  Abruptly he was gone, out of the
	Labyrinth of stone and into a much vaster labyrinth of myriad
	possible realities.  He left behind him a banshee-like moan of
	despair, as his form faded away into elsewhere.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch found himself standing
	alone, unaffected, the sole person remaining on the floor of the
	great cavern.  The others had all climbed up or been forcibly zoned
	out.  He crouched, eying his enemy over the rim of his dented
	shield.  He knew he had no chance of winning this fight solo.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Minotaur appeared to be
	healing rapidly, regenerating all the hurts inflicted upon it by the
	Federation's dungeon commandos.   It looked at Torch and held up one
	massive finger.  Then it pointed at him, spoke a word or two, and
	flicked a glance upward.  He understood.  He was being let go. 
	Though he could not say why.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch slung his shield on his back
	and hung his ax back on his belt.  Then he sprinted to the nearest
	rope and leaped onto it, climbing swiftly, lest the implacable
	victorious guardian of the List should change his mind.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	friendly enough, swapping tales over brews.  Given his colorful
	history as a law enforcement official, Roger Sarner had plenty of
	anecdotes to contribute.  He was just warming up to a recitation of
	the story of that Mall brain house that they'd busted in San Mateo
	last year &ndash; one of the last raids he'd been on where things
	had gone persistently right &ndash; when suddenly he felt the brief
	dizzy dislocation and his surroundings faded to grey blankness.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He came to lying on a bed.  In

	abort codewords from you, which I expect are stored either in your
	head, or here in your quarters.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I don't know what you're
	talking about.  But if you think I'd cooperate with you, you're not
	nearly as smart as your reputation suggests.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">With so many lives at stake
	Mr. Sarner, I regret to say that I don't intend to give you a choice
	in the matter.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It's Secretary Sarner, to
	you.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin shook his head.  &ldquo;Not
	anymore.  Your own Federation Congress passed a resolution removing
	you, just last week.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds doesn't have the
	authority to pass bills!&rdquo; he snapped irritably.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">True.  So perhaps you are
	unaware that the Cyberantes, acting on information provided to them
	by the senator, have recently effected the release of all of the
	other elected officials whom you were holding hostage?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner colored with anger, and
	looked past Justin down the hallway, seeking movement.  Justin
	looked back over his shoulder for an instant, and gave a marginal
	head shake.  &ldquo;Your men all remain trapped in Palandria,
	Sarner.  And I've made certain that our meeting won't be interrupted
	otherwise.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Will you let them out, as
	well?&rdquo; he asked, to buy time while he considered.   Was Justin
	armed?  Did he have men surrounding the building?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Of course.  Your immersion
	units are rather basic, and I'm afraid the physical well being of
	your followers' bodies will begin to deteriorate if they're not
	released soon.   To say nothing of possible dangers to their
	sanity.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Your trap hasn't affected
	me,&rdquo; Sarner said with belligerence.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not a lot,&rdquo; Justin
	admitted.  &ldquo;But then, you've arguably been insane for a long
	time.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You think it's insane to
	resist what you are, what the Singularity is doing to the human
	race?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not necessarily.  But it's
	certainly insane to impose the consequences of your views on other
	people, and to think that you possess some innate right to do so.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner drew himself up to his full
	height.  &ldquo;Anarchists like you have had the run of this planet
	long enough!&rdquo; he began.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Roger, you are being
	tedious,&rdquo; Justin cut across him.  &ldquo;I did not come here
	to debate political philosophy with a truncheon-wielding thug. 
	Let's discuss the abort codes.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner smiled grimly, as if he
	were certain that he had Justin trapped now.  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he
	said softly.  &ldquo;What are you going to do now that I've refused,
	beat it out of me?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Nothing so mundane.&rdquo; 
	Justin withdrew from his pants pocket a small device, about the size
	of an antique cell phone.  &ldquo;This is a quantum state scanner. 
	With it I can image every last molecule of your brain.  Once
	instantiated in a computing substrate, obtaining the information I
	need from you becomes a matter of a simple database query.  I did
	however wish to give you the opportunity for voluntary limited
	cooperation before resorting to copying your memory wholesale.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner backed up a pace, toward
	his jacket that lay flung over the top of a chair.  He found himself
	disinclined to doubt the credibility of Justin's threat.  &ldquo;So
	how does stealing my memories equate to all your high-flown
	non-aggression principles?&rdquo; he protested to gain time.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It doesn't, I admit.   But
	the threat which you have leveled against the lives of the many
	thousands who could never evacuate in time, in Columbus and
	elsewhere, compels me to choose between several evils.  And since
	you have spent basically your whole life perpetrating aggression
	through your service in government, your being subjected to a taste
	of it yourself does seem to me to fall under the rubric of just
	desserts.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">With a lunge, Sarner completed his
	movement toward his jacket, and extracted his sidearm from its
	pocket.  &ldquo;I'll give you some just dessert, at 3000 feet per
	second,&rdquo; he snarled, and snapped off two quick shots at
	Justin's chest.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And somehow missed, both times. 
	As he stood shocked by his errant aim, Justin gestured sharply with
	his free hand.  A misty grey tentacle lashed out like a whip from
	his fingers, curled painfully around Sarner's wrist, wrenched the
	gun out of his hand, and flung it across the room where it bounced
	off the wall and fell to the carpet.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You're being tedious again,
	Roger,&rdquo; Justin said warningly, and raised his scanning device.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As the whip-like tentacle faded
	back into incorporeality, Sarner reflexively massaged his own wrist,
	and like a stroke of lightning he suddenly understood.  This wasn't
	real reality at all!  They were still in one of Justin's damned
	simulations.  All that talk about releasing him was just a trick.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Like a suddenly maddened bull,
	Sarner hurled himself roughly past Justin through the doorway and
	into the hallway outside.  Then he turned agilely on his heel,
	almost pivoting, and sprinted down the passageway.  He could hear
	Justin coming out into the hall to follow him.  Good.  He weaved
	some, trying to make it more difficult for Justin to aim the scanner
	at him.  He wondered if he'd be able to sense it when it hit him,
	and how long the scan would take.  Probably only a matter of
	seconds.  As soon as he could, he turned off into an internal
	stairway.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He pounded up two flights, forming
	a plan in his head.  He had little hope that he could do Justin any
	lasting harm in a virtual space.  He'd certainly taken being shot at
	in stride.  But Roger now knew that there were rules in all
	virtualities, and suspected that if he could force Justin's avatar
	to take enough damage, he might have to abandon it, giving himself
	time to escape by zoning somewhere else.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner came out onto the apartment
	building's roof garden, which had a balcony railing offering a nice
	view of the street four stories below.   It was late afternoon, the
	westering sun warmly lighting a virtually cloudless summer sky. 
	Both the roof and the street were untenanted, unheard of at this
	hour.  But then, why add needless clutter to a simulation?  He took
	his position against the building, just behind the door, facing the
	railing.  He struggled to silence his elevated breathing.  These
	simulations were inconveniently good, sometimes.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin was only a few seconds
	behind him.  He came out into the doorway, eyes flicking over the
	roof looking for Sarner.  With a silent pounce, Sarner slapped the
	scanning device out of his hand, curled the other arm around
	Justin's shoulders and with an angry spasm of strength, knocked him
	tumbling over the balcony into space.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Hardly able to believe that he had
	done it so easily, Sarner ran to the railing and looked down.  He
	was actually in time to see Justin landing, more or less on his
	feet.  His lower legs seemed to blur slightly, as if becoming
	partially transparent.  Somehow, that seemed to absorb the energy of
	his fall, so that when his feet re-solidified Justin was standing
	calmly on the pavement.  <I>Damn,</I> Sarner thought.  He should
	have guessed he'd have some magical trick up his sleeve.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Roger Sarner's mind raced.  What
	should he do now?  Pick up the scanner and run?  But Justin could
	follow, and if he could bend the rules of this simulation some more,
	he might even catch up.  If he regained his device, it meant the end
	of what was probably their last remaining hope for victory.  There
	wasn't time to figure out how to destroy or disassemble it. 
	Imperative to keep him separated from it, then.  But what was the
	best way to do that?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It suddenly struck him, almost as
	if the door to the roof had smacked into his forehead, that Justin
	hadn't bent the rules at all.  Where had he said all his men were? 
	<I>Still in Palandria.</I>  Which meant that all these
	Minotaur-projected simulations, including this one, must be subsets
	of the overall Palandria virtuality.  So Justin's miraculous safe
	landing was nothing more than a variation on his own safe-fall
	ability.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Which meant that he had another
	option.  He could attack.  He could go after Justin, try to beat the
	shit out of him, keep him too busy to go get his scanner.  Justin
	might be some kind of wizard, but Sarner was willing to bet that he
	himself was a lot tougher hand-to-hand than a slight, effeminate
	intellectual loser like Justin could ever be.  He'd learned long ago
	that in most situations, choosing whichever was the more radical and
	aggressive action usually got the best results.  It kept the enemy
	off balance.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Roger bounced, catlike, up onto
	the balcony wall in a crouch.  For the first time, Justin registered
	true surprise, followed immediately by concern.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Roger, I really wouldn't do
	that.  Don't be a fool,&rdquo; he called.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'll bet you wouldn't,&rdquo;
	he said contemptuously.  Sarner's heart leaped, seeing his enemy's
	naked fear.   And an instant later, so did he, and activated his
	safe-fall ability.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A sort of red and black explosion
	engulfed him.  He felt a sharp, painful shock and heard an odd
	cracking thump.  Everything seemed to spin around him, leaving him
	completely disoriented.  When his vision cleared, he realized he was
	lying on his side on the street, so out of breath that black spots
	swam before his eyes.  An incongruous shaft of splintered, bloody
	white bone projected up more than a foot above his knee.  He took a
	gasping breath, only to giggle it out again painfully as the attempt
	to work his lungs produced searing agony.  The gasping/exhaling
	reflex went on convulsively, much like being zone-looped, only in
	his body with white hot pokers buried in his chest.  His heart was
	pounding and he could not will his limbs to move.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin stepped into the narrowed
	range of his vision, knelt down beside him.   &ldquo;You utter
	goddamned fool,&rdquo; he said in a low voice.  &ldquo;This isn't a
	simulation, it's reality you stupid goof!  I've sent for help.  But
	they may not make it here in time.&rdquo;  Justin rose to his feet
	again, and seemed to float upwards as though weightless, out of
	Sarner's vision.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This couldn't be real.  It had to
	be a trick.  But he'd never, ever felt pain like this.  With a
	massive effort of will, Sarner forced his spastic breathing under
	control, made himself inhale shallowly, regularly, ignoring the
	sharp spears of pain in his diaphragm.  Shattered ribs?  Probably.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Shortly, Justin was standing next
	to him again, aiming the scanning device at him.  Sarner glared up
	at him, doing his best to radiate rage.  He felt nothing from the
	scanner.  Justin checked the display, raised an eyebrow, shook his
	head, knelt down next to him again.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This isn't a medical
	scanner, but it does give some indication,&rdquo; he explained. 
	&ldquo;You have three compound fractures of your right leg and one
	in your left.  Your back is broken.  Several of your ribs have
	separated from your spine.  You're losing a lot of blood.  All of
	that is fixable if you can be stabilized, but I'm afraid you don't
	have long.  I don't have the necessary equipment to do anything for
	you.  I'm sorry.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner gritted his teeth,
	swallowed down a glob of coppery tasting bile that rose in his
	throat, and forced himself to gasp out words.  &ldquo;Did you...
	get&ndash;&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What I came for?  Yes. 
	Your knowledge of how to save hundreds of thousands of lives will
	not die with you.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">To live like zombies, in simulated
	lives.  How was that really better than being dead?  But there was
	something that still didn't make sense.  The pain and immobility was
	making his thoughts sluggish.  Was that happening because he
	believed in this simulation?  Was he dying for real because his mind
	thought he was?  Oh yes, that was it.  This couldn't be reality
	because Justin had done things here that were impossible.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">How did... you...&rdquo; 
	He could not complete the question.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But Justin understood it.  &ldquo;I
	thought that you might be inclined to knock me around a bit when you
	came out of it.  So I took the precaution of arriving in a foglet
	body, instead of my usual cellular one.  This form is made of a
	dense swarm of nanobots, packed tightly enough to give it definite
	form and weight, and make it able to manipulate objects, to generate
	speech sounds, and so forth.  I control the foglet swarm via a
	wireless VPN.  The same technique was used to simulate not myself,
	but Robert Reynolds and his two watchdogs, at our arranged
	conference.  Actually, we'd already rescued Reynolds and stashed his
	guards in a hotel room.&rdquo;  He paused.  &ldquo;Incidentally,
	you're a pretty good shot at burglar range.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">If Sarner could have thrashed and
	howled on the ground, he would have done.  This plausible
	explanation raised the horrible, awful possibility that his current
	plight might just be real.  As before, after the battle at Phoenix,
	he wanted a do-over with all his soul.  Why hadn't he listened? 
	Justin had even warned him!  The ambulance simply <I>must</I> arrive
	in time.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I don't&ndash;&rdquo; he
	gasped out desperately, inarticulate with pain and fear and dimming
	vision.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But once again, Justin understood
	him.  &ldquo;Don't want to die?  Most men don't want to die, Roger. 
	If I had the power of saving you, I would.  Not because you deserve
	it, but because withholding such aid would be tantamount to murder.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin was silent for a minute,
	studied his scanner display again.  Sarner listened in vain for
	sirens, or an approaching vehicle, or footsteps.   After a while,
	Justin spoke again.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I expect you will lose
	consciousness soon,&rdquo; he stated baldly.  &ldquo;I suppose there
	is some chance that someone will put your name in, someday, for a
	TDR from Paradise Systems.  In which case, we may meet again.  I
	only know that I shan't be putting your name in.  If you have any
	religious convictions, it might be wise to focus your remaining
	moments of awareness on such concerns.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin rose, and Sarner found
	himself wishing he could restrain him.  He didn't want to be left
	alone.  He was beginning to shiver with cold, and it was getting
	harder and harder to breathe.  He remembered the sniper who'd fallen
	to his death during their raid in L.A.  It was strange to think that
	he was now sharing that poor bastard's fate.  It sunk in, belatedly,
	what Justin was talking about: being resurrected by the Last Trumpet
	Project.  Bitter laughter rang in his mind.  That such should be his
	last hope.  That was rich.  What would his friend Maxwell Cleary
	say?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A rushing noise, like a high wind,
	sounded distantly in his ears.  What was that?  Death angels? 
	Justin's foglet body launching itself into the heavens to bring on
	the Rapture like some ludicrous counterfeit Jesus?</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Dimly, he heard his enemy say,
	cheerfully: &ldquo;Then again, it could just be your lucky day.&rdquo;
	 He felt a flare of impotent anger.   How could this be his lucky
	day?  Then belatedly he put the statement together with the noise. 
	<I>Aircar!  </I>Dropping out of the sky.  Help was arriving!</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But the darkness was rising within
	him, as if the earth were swallowing him, or he was sinking into it.
	 Pain, along with sight, was fading.   His very surroundings seemed
	to pulse around him in time with his heartbeat.  Like a blossom
	opening in his mind, Roger Sarner saw the face, not of Jesus, but of
	his late mother.  Her severe mouth, perpetually compressed into a
	straight line of disapproval, and her accusing blue eyes, confronted
	him as sternly as if he were still a small boy caught sluffing off
	on his schoolwork.  Abashed, with nothing to say in defense, he hung
	his head as the blackness overwhelmed him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He hung his head in shame because
	he was a failure.</FONT></DIV>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So how

	nuisance of themselves?&rdquo; Stefan asked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Quite a few, actually,&rdquo;
	Clay replied.  &ldquo;Several thousand.  But not that many of them
	are still being a pain, these days.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Eutropian morning was well
	advanced, but the huge disk of its sister planet had not yet rolled
	behind the western horizon.  The resulting effect was a peculiar,
	multi-hued lighting of objects, particularly on their western sides.
	 They sat in the observation deck near the top of the very tower
	where Justin had met with Petrov to ask for his help with Project
	housing, late last year.  The crystalline skyscrapers of the island
	city now found in the bay to the west reflected the light of both
	sun and sister planet like a distant, glittering pile of gems.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Federation's remaining
	men are scattered,&rdquo; Clay went on.  &ldquo;Some of them have
	joined the KOJ, some have obeyed the cease fire proclaimed by
	acting-President Reynolds, and a lot have just quit &ndash; I expect
	being unpaid doesn't help.  As you know, we helped Reynolds' people
	get the usable nukes all wrapped up, and that seems to have thrown
	them for a loop as well.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">In the month since
	Secretary Sarner's death, confusion has reigned among many
	Federation personnel,&rdquo; Justin agreed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Did Roger Sarner really
	jump off a building to his death?&rdquo; Salma asked.  She had
	rapidly lost all awe of Justin soon after Stefan had introduced
	them, and understood that he was an eyewitness.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Indeed, he did,&rdquo;
	Justin replied.  &ldquo;But I don't think he meant to commit
	suicide.  He believed himself to be in a simulation.  I summoned
	medical assistance, but he was pronounced DOA at the hospital
	facility.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well I shan't shed any
	tears for him,&rdquo; Clay said emphatically.  &ldquo;What he and
	Cleary started is still going on.  We keep thinking that the IADC
	will be able to stand down any time now.  But every day it seems
	we're responding to more alerts from subscribers.  It isn't
	organized military or police squads anymore, as a rule.  More like
	street gangs.  Roving bands of Moshes are getting liquored up, or
	amped up on Luddite religious fervor, and going around beating and
	burning, razing buildings, and killing anyone who tries to stop
	them.  As soon as our teams show up with overwhelming force, they
	scatter.  The ones we catch we've been turning over to Reynolds'
	people for prosecution.   But they almost never stand and fight. 
	It's like a game of let's see how much we can destroy and who we can
	hurt before the law shows up.  There's no longer any real point to
	it.  It's just random violence.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There may be no central
	organization anymore, but the destructive conduct does still serve a
	purpose in the eyes of those who are engaging in it,&rdquo; Justin
	commented.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And what's that?&rdquo;
	Stefan wondered aloud.  &ldquo;I confess it seems completely
	irrational to me.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Of course it's irrational. 
	We've managed to thwart all of their organized plans for destroying
	the cyberverse.  Yet they still believe they're at war, and even
	that they're destined to win, some of them.  This kind of petty
	terrorism is often seen from those who are predisposed to violent
	means, and yet at the same time feel almost completely powerless.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And I suppose we Cyberantes
	are making them feel even more powerless,&rdquo; offered Clay.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Very likely.   Which is a
	leading reason why defensive force, no matter how overwhelming or
	efficiently applied, is unlikely to produce lasting peace.   Petrov
	and I set in motion a plan to distract them from meatspace violence
	by giving them something, a goal, to chase in the cyberverse.  It
	bought us about two months' respite, during which a part of Sarner's
	forces spent much of their time jacked in, while the rest, and
	Cleary's KOJ people (who wouldn't countenance getting neural
	implants installed) basically waited around for them to succeed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Most of the Federation
	people who were working that angle in the cyberverse were among the
	quitters that you mentioned.  It seems quite a few of them decided
	that the cyberverse was actually pretty cool once you got to know
	it.  We released all the ones who were trapped, naturally.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">How did you manage to do
	that?  Trap them, I mean?&rdquo; Clay asked curiously.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A tight feedback loop that
	kept their neocortexes in a constant state of incipient zoning.  It
	works by exploiting the slow reaction and recycle time of their
	interfaced neurons.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Meaning it wouldn't work on
	a Full Sing,&rdquo; Stefan said with a sly smile.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Correct.  In fact even
	Sarner's people could probably have broken out, if they'd just let
	themselves zone over and over again as fast as possible.  The
	natural inclination, though, would be to do just the opposite.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But they were chasing a
	mirage in any case, weren't they?&rdquo; Salma inquired.  &ldquo;I
	mean there is no Master Node List hidden in the cyberverse, is
	there?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not in the sense that they
	imagined,&rdquo; Justin allowed with an impish expression.  &ldquo;But
	there is a List, though.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Stefan stared at Justin, and then
	guffawed.  The others smiled, but didn't find anything hilarious.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So what do you think we
	should do next, Justin?&rdquo; Clay asked.  &ldquo;This random gang
	violence, anti-computer terrorism, whatever you want to call it,
	isn't going away, and from what I've seen in the news it's spreading
	widely around the world.  Particularly in cultures that were never
	terribly enamored of high-tech to begin with.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I expect,&rdquo; replied
	Justin cryptically, &ldquo;that an answer to that question will be
	forthcoming soon.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This was not the hoped-for
	response, and a lengthy silence ensued in which they all merely
	enjoyed the burgeoning Eutropian morning.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A woman suddenly appeared,
	climbing up the embedded spiral stairs onto the deck.  She was
	petite, Asian, her face beautiful but somehow incredibly formidable
	at the same time.  She was clad in a floor-length form-fitting dress
	made of brilliant crimson silk.  Justin rose to greet Riksana with a
	welcoming smile, and she crossed to him to share a brief kiss.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I presume that was good
	timing,&rdquo; Stefan said in his deep voice, offering her his hand,
	which she took.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Oh?  I'm not late, I
	trust,&rdquo; she said casually.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not at all,&rdquo; Justin
	assured her.  &ldquo;Are you where I think you are?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana nodded, smiling. 
	&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Then may I introduce Clay
	Thorsten and Salma Rivera, both principals in the Cyberantes
	organization.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana Namoto,&rdquo; she
	said, shaking each of their hands briskly.  They all took seats
	around one of the large tables, Clay deploying its umbrella.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That is a lovely dress, Ms.
	Namoto,&rdquo; Salma complimented.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Oh, please call me Riksana.
	 Thank you.  Our mutual friend Cylara designed it for me.  She
	speaks fondly of you &ndash; both of you,&rdquo; she amended,
	gesturing across the table to include Clay.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And where exactly is it
	that you are, apart from here in Eutropia?&rdquo; Stefan asked,
	raising an eyebrow.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Right now, I'm living on
	Alpha Centauri II.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The two biological Sings were
	completely stunned by this.  Stefan grinned and exchanged a look
	with Justin.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Two weeks ago,&rdquo;
	Riksana went on, &ldquo;the spaceship <I>Thorne</I> made landfall on
	the second planetoid in the Centauri system.  It's your basic barren
	rock in space: plenty of minerals and a whisper thin atmosphere but
	no indigenous life.  The ship's complement of manufacturing nanobots
	were able to construct diamondoid molecular circuitry out of local
	materials, along with nanosolar cells for power.  We now have a
	high-capacity brain house built on that planet, and the settlement
	is expanding rapidly.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That's fantastic,&rdquo;
	Clay opined.  &ldquo;But how are you speaking to us live, in real
	time?  Even the telecom link through the wormhole would be lagged by
	a few seconds I would think.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana beamed appreciatively. 
	&ldquo;Very astute, Clay.  In truth I have almost no transmission
	lag at all.  The host for this instance of the lovely Eutropia
	simulation is located in high Earth orbit.  And so is my quantum
	networking terminal.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Entangled particles,&rdquo;
	Salma said, marveling.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes.  Which allow
	transmission of binary data instantaneously across any arbitrary
	distance by manipulating the states of the entangled particles at
	both ends.  I uploaded the program to Kip, the AI on the <I>Thorne</I>,
	via the wormhole connection.  One end of the quantum terminal is now
	running on the hardware in the Centauri brain house, the other in
	Earth orbit.  We can now stripe data, or multi-thread any software,
	across hosts in different star systems any distance apart, without
	even needing to use a wormhole communications pipe.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Wow,&rdquo; Clay said,
	digesting the implications.  &ldquo;But don't you have to send the
	entangled matter through the wormhole?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana shook her head.  &ldquo;No.
	 All you have to do is transmit the quantum state details of the
	subject matter at one end.  You then find suitably identical
	particles at the other end.  In the lab we used free hydrogen atoms,
	for simplicity.  The entanglement is then applied energetically. 
	You only need the wormhole to bootstrap the process.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Stefan looked like a child buried
	in Christmas presents, as he savored every word of Riksana's
	explanations, though he'd obviously heard it all before.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But if you can pattern
	quantum entanglements by the application of energy...&rdquo; Clay
	trailed off, not sure where this would lead.  Physics was never his
	strongest subject.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Exactly!&rdquo; Stefan
	agreed exultantly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Exactly what?&rdquo; Salma
	asked, openly puzzled.  &ldquo;You physicists need to explain to us
	lay people.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana looked genuinely
	apologetic.  &ldquo;Do forgive me.   To conclude succinctly, the
	quantum networking technology was needed in order to utilize
	effectively another invention: the energetic patterning of matter
	for cold computing.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Clay laughed.  &ldquo;I'm afraid
	that was a bit too succinct.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin broke in.  &ldquo;You know
	that for years now, we've been doing computing and data storage with
	molecules, and in three dimensions.  In cases where the energy
	required to effect binary state changes in the molecules can be
	recovered and reused, instead of being dissipated as waste heat,
	this is known as reversible computing, or cold computing.  It's
	never completely cold of course, because the nature of any useful
	program is that inputs and outputs will not be conserved, and hence
	those can never be recycled or reversed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So with current technology
	we are still faced with two problems, two limitations if you will:
	the need to construct the molecular structures used for computing
	(usually by means of nano-scale molecular manufacturing robots), and
	the need to supply operating power to the computers once built.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was seriously suggested
	more than forty years ago that computing could also be done using
	any arbitrary matter.  A lump of rock, for example.  A given weight
	of solid material contains an astronomical number of atoms, each of
	which possesses a number of intrinsic characteristics that could
	potentially be used to represent 0 and 1: vibration rates, electron
	shell states, spin, charge, etc.  The trouble is, the atoms in a
	lump of rock exhibit these characteristics at random.  That is, the
	naturally occurring values represent no meaningful data and perform
	no useful work.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The research done by
	Riksana, and others, demonstrated that matter could be patterned &ndash;
	aligned, if you will &ndash; so that a requisite percentage of its
	constituent atoms adopted consistent desired values for one or more
	of their intrinsic characteristics which could then be utilized as
	qubits.  And that this patterning could be achieved by means of the
	targeted projection of a type of quantum energy, sometimes known as
	transverse energy, which permeates the unified field.  Liken it if
	you will to a process of applying energy through ordinary heating,
	but with the important difference that while heating increases
	ambient energy, it does not simultaneously decrease the degree of
	randomness.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Basically, we no longer
	need to build computers,&rdquo; Riksana stated bluntly.  &ldquo;We
	can just pattern matter, in almost any form, to <I>act</I> as a
	computer when we want it to.  Or to store information.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And once you've done that,&rdquo;
	Clay said slowly, &ldquo;you don't have to apply any more energy to
	it?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No.  Not unless it runs
	down by dint of expending energy transmitting results outside the
	sample of patterned matter.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But if some of the atoms in
	the sample were quantum entangled with other atoms at the location
	where you wanted the results sent, and those atoms were part of the
	logic gate...&rdquo; Salma breathed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana nodded.  &ldquo;Very good.
	 Which did create a problem of reverse feedback for us.  We don't
	want something at the destination to tweak the particles at the end
	of the logic gates in reverse, and thus mess up the computation
	results in the constituent matter.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And how on earth did you
	solve that, by the way?&rdquo; Stefan wanted to know, suddenly
	serious.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Energy state barriers,
	proactively insulating the receptor particles without altering their
	qubit values.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Stefan whistled.  &ldquo;I'd like
	to see the equations governing that.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'll see that you get
	them,&rdquo; Riksana promised.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So now that you can sort of
	point at a rock and go, &ldquo;Thou art a computer!&rdquo; and then
	network all the rocks together in real time, you can literally build
	a server that has components all across the universe,&rdquo; Clay
	summed up.  He looked up speculatively at the sky.  &ldquo;You know,
	as a marketing guy, I think I could sell that.&rdquo;  Everyone
	laughed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well that will certainly
	put civilization beyond the reach of any future Operation Skull
	Fractures,&rdquo; Salma said.  &ldquo;But I don't see how it will
	help us with our Mosh terrorist problem.  Not unless you can
	re-pattern the brain cells of the Reverend Clearys and Roger Sarners
	of the world so that they suddenly see reason.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">No, that wouldn't work,&rdquo;
	Justin agreed.  &ldquo;We could pattern some of the atoms in their
	brains, I suppose &ndash; though as a rule it would be better to
	choose a more durable arrangement of matter, such as a rock, rather
	than something subject to biological processes, because those tend
	to swap around a lot of atoms fairly rapidly.  But in any case,
	computing with the atoms in a brain wouldn't change the function of
	the brain at the cellular level.  And even supposing that it did,
	and in a controllable way, it would be most unethical.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Nevertheless you hinted you
	<I>do</I> have a solution,&rdquo; Stefan reminded him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin grinned enigmatically.  &ldquo;Oh
	yes.  But not immediately.   We still have a lot more work to do.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Who is this 'we' of whom
	you speak, white man?&rdquo; Riksana asked with feigned indignation.
	 &ldquo;I'll have you know, as of now I'm officially on sabbatical. 
	Or vacation even, in the great new tourist trap destination, with
	tin man Kip and his merry crew of nanobot castaways, guarding the
	golden fleece from the centaurs at the end of the wormhole rainbow. 
	And I <I>do</I> expect some companionship in my travels.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin stared at her, apparently
	dumbfounded.  &ldquo;It might be wise, if you didn't try to network
	so many <I>metaphors</I>,&rdquo; he cautioned solemnly.  Then he
	brightened.  &ldquo;But of course, I'll come with you.  I've been
	looking forward to Alpha-C.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But what's <I>there?</I>&rdquo;
	Salma said.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Riksana shrugged.  &ldquo;Whatever
	we want to put there.  Same as here.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You should kidnap Petrov
	and get him to build the Alpha-C II that everybody imagined they'd
	find when squishy humans finally reached the place,&rdquo; Stefan
	suggested.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We won't need to kidnap
	him,&rdquo; Justin predicted.  &ldquo;I'm sure he'll be there faster
	than you can charm a quark.&rdquo;  He furrowed his brow slightly as
	if something had just occurred to him.  &ldquo;You know, Stefan,&rdquo;
	he continued, &ldquo;we'll be able to pattern quite a lot of matter
	in the Centauri system.  Very stable matter.  Lifeless,
	climate-less, tectonically inactive.  How many souls are you
	planning to send us in, say, the next year?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Stefan rolled his eyes.  &ldquo;So
	what am I now, Hades?  Whereas you're Hermes, she's Athena, Petrov
	is presumably Hephaestus, though at least we haven't got a Zeus yet
	&ndash; thank God!  If you please, Justin, <I>we are now doing TDRs</I>
	at the rate of about two hundred thousand per day and building. 
	Your consortium is going to open-source the technology for the
	matter patterning, I presume?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin and Riksana nodded.  &ldquo;We'll
	publish the scientific white papers and the algorithms,&rdquo;
	Riksana confirmed.  &ldquo;I expect computer hardware providers will
	all write their own control firmware.  Or ours will be available to
	license, if they prefer.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Then I might get the rest
	of my two billion yottacalcs a lot faster,&rdquo; Stefan said with
	satisfaction.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yeah,&rdquo; Justin said. 
	&ldquo;Not exactly a shortage of non-living, low-energy dense matter
	in two solar systems.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You people really are a bit
	like gods,&rdquo; Salma remarked, awed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Humans aren't godlike yet,&rdquo;
	Riksana disagreed modestly.  &ldquo;But, we're coming along.&rdquo; 
	And she smiled.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sailboat
	races, eh?&rdquo;  An unfamiliar voice penetrated Torch's reverie as
	he gazed out at the regatta forming up in the harbor below, sleek
	sailboats of all descriptions and designs flashing in the brilliant
	morning sunshine.  He nodded minimally, keeping his attention
	focused on the yachts being prepared, hoping that his lack of any
	further response would motivate the speaker to do the polite thing
	and simply move away.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A new passion of yours, or
	are you just punishing yourself for having alienated your
	girlfriend?&rdquo; the speaker continued in an amused tone.  Irked,
	and disturbed by the obvious implication that this person must know
	him, Torch turned his head and glared at the source of the voice.  
	He was astonished to recognize Justin Turrell standing there,
	dressed in casual clothes topped by a windbreaker.  The lively
	breeze twitched his short, sandy hair; a friendly smile suffused his
	face.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">May I?&rdquo; Justin
	continued, gesturing at the empty bench spot next to Torch.  Still
	stunned, Torch acquiesced.  What could Justin possibly want with
	him, now?  He'd given up on the quest for the Master Node List after
	Roger Sarner died.  Though he hadn't yet dared to level with his
	father about what he was really doing in the cyberverse these days. 
	It was odd that his psycho-pattern detector, which he still carried
	with him, hadn't even alerted him that Justin was in the vicinity.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin discerned the ticket stubs
	protruding from the top of Torch's breast pocket.  &ldquo;Ah, I see.
	 You are wagering on the race results.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch shrugged.  &ldquo;So?  Man
	has a right to spend his paycheck how he likes.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Indubitably.  But you earn
	your pay mainly by working in meatspace, yes?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch flicked him an indifferent
	glance.  &ldquo;Not that it's your business, but yes, I've found
	that I can earn more money quickly by taking contract jobs from
	here, to be performed there.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin nodded pleasantly.  &ldquo;A
	wage price differential which naturally results from the fact that
	most people would rather spend their time here, than there.  A pity
	that endemic scarcity and government interference prevent meatspace
	from having the same standard of living as the cyberverse.&quot;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So what's your point, that
	the cyberverse is more popular than real life?  Have you come here
	to gloat, is that it?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Not at all.  The mere
	recognition of facts which are determined by the sum of billions of
	individual choices seems to me like a poor excuse for gloating. 
	Though I would observe that your own choice of leisure activities
	hardly seems to separate you from the silent majority.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch shrugged again.  &ldquo;I've
	always recognized that the cyberverse offered enormous possibilities
	for enjoyment.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin was silent for a moment,
	scanning the assembling racing craft being chivvied into starting
	formation by their crews.  &ldquo;And yet, you insisted to yourself
	that you only wanted Cylara on your terms, in real reality.   Why
	were those terms so imperative to you?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch had wondered that himself. 
	But he wasn't about to give Justin the satisfaction of knowing this.
	 &ldquo;If I wanted a relationship counselor, I'd go see one,&rdquo;
	he said irritably.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin chuckled quietly, but in a
	kindly way rather than a derisive one.  &ldquo;I'm not here to
	counsel you, either.  You already know all the answers to your
	difficulties, I'm sure.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Then why are you here,
	Justin?&rdquo; Torch asked, turning to look him full in the face for
	the first time.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">To give you some
	information, of course.  And to offer some explanations on points
	you may have wondered about.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What sort of information? 
	I should warn you, I'm through being manipulated by other people.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Very wise.  The information
	is simply this: a short time ago, a team of Full Sing researchers
	perfected a means of patterning matter to perform computation, and
	to network that matter together at the quantum level.  As a
	consequence, non-biological consciousness can now reside in any
	matter whatsoever, without the need to change its outward form.  In
	a relatively short span of time, we'll be able to pattern enough
	matter to host the collective consciousness of all Sings, including
	millions of TDR clients, along with the entirety of the cyberverse
	as it exists today.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch digested this for a while,
	wondering whether Justin was bluffing.  &ldquo;Which means,&rdquo;
	he concluded slowly, &ldquo;that any efforts to destroy the world's
	computing equipment will become moot.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Exactly.  Which in turn
	implies that your KOJ's quixotic quest to destroy certain computer
	hardware, or all hardware everywhere, becomes pointless, even were
	it an achievable goal &ndash; which it is not.  Instead, they would
	need to destroy all solid matter.  And not just here on Earth, but
	throughout the solar system.  Indeed, throughout <I>two</I> solar
	systems &ndash; so far &ndash; because we're now patterning matter
	in the Alpha Centauri system as well, in the wake of a successful
	colonization mission.  Which means, Torch, that only God could
	destroy the cyberverse, now.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well perhaps He will, then.
	 My father believes&ndash;&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Your father believes that
	the righteous must triumph, because he has a jaundiced view of who
	the righteous are, and above all because he <I>needs</I> to believe
	it.  The set of values and cosmological truths to which he
	subscribes leaves him no other choice, regardless of the realities
	of the situation.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">People like my father have
	the right to defend their way of life,&rdquo; Torch argued.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They do.  But their right
	ends where they attempt to impose their way of life on others.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But how can these different
	views on the very nature of living possibly coexist?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin gave him a sympathetic
	look.  &ldquo;You've encountered enough trouble trying to harmonize
	them within yourself, haven't you?  However, you beg the question. 
	Coexistence is what's required.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But if one viewpoint
	requires the extinction of the other...&rdquo; Torch trailed off.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Then that is the classic
	pattern for war, and so each must be prevented from wreaking
	destruction upon the other.  That is exactly what I have attempted
	to do.  And I want to thank you for the part you've played toward
	achieving that end.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This sounded to Torch like Justin
	was saying he'd been manipulated even more than he knew, which only
	made him angrier.  &ldquo;I haven't been working for you.  In trying
	to find your List, we acted on a tip given us by members <I>of your
	own community </I>who are working at cross-purposes with you.  I
	wonder what <I>they</I> think of your matter patterning plan.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Actually, they're ecstatic
	about it.&rdquo;  Justin sighed.  &ldquo;We told you that that was
	the case, because <I>that is how Moshes might behave.</I>  Thus, you
	would be inclined to believe it.  Humanity grew up in a world of
	scarce resources, one group forced to compete against another.  As a
	result, many people have always imagined that life is a zero-sum
	game.  In order for you to win, someone else has to lose.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Fortunately that has never
	been strictly true, and humanity's progress over time is proof of
	this.  But it is certainly no longer the case in our
	post-Singularity universe.  Thanks to human creativity, a paradigm
	of abundance has replaced that of scarcity.  If anyone in <I>our
	</I>community truly wanted to create their own network, or make a
	brand new cyberverse, there is absolutely no reason why they
	couldn't just go do it.  Nor would they have to destroy anything
	that already existed, or take anything away from anyone else, in
	order to do so.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch mulled this over.  It
	certainly had the ring of truth, especially given this latest
	advancement about matter patterning.  &ldquo;So what you're telling
	me is that the whole business with the Master Node List was a hoax.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin agreed pleasantly: &ldquo;Of
	course it was.  I wasn't sure you'd all believe it, given that the
	whole concept flies in the face of everything that's ever been
	published about DR.OS &ndash; including the source code!  But Petrov
	was convinced you would, because the existence of a secret central
	control mechanism chimed with everything in Mosh history, which
	after all has been replete with cabals and cartels and shadow
	governments and secret societies and inner sanctums for millennia.  
	And he was right.  My friend Petrov is a truly wise being.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Only Sarner suspected it
	might be a trick,&rdquo; Torch recalled.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Because he possessed a
	serpentine kind of mind, and such thinking came naturally to him. 
	In the end of course, he thought I was tricking him when I wasn't,
	and died for his mistake.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So why the hoax, then?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">To forestall further
	violence in meatspace.  We were never truly worried about ourselves,
	you understand.   But we felt an obligation to keep the Moshes and
	the bio-Sings from killing one another.  And, for nearly two months
	following Phoenix, it worked reasonably well.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I expect it also bought you
	time to make your matter breakthrough.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Quite true.  But that would
	have happened anyway.  However, now that we've got it, I believe we
	can do something about that coexistence problem we discussed
	earlier.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That sounded interesting, but
	Torch sensed Justin wasn't likely to give him any previews of their
	plans.  &ldquo;So why are we having this conversation, exactly?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As I said, I wanted to
	thank you for playing your part.  Of course you weren't working for
	me, and had you been, you could never have done the job we needed
	you to do nearly as well as you did it.  But I do recognize that you
	have taken harm from playing this role, and I hoped I might be able
	to help you recover from some of its consequences.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch sighed wearily.  &ldquo;I
	betrayed my friends.  I lost the woman I love.  I've come to
	question everything I ever believed.  And on top of that I failed,
	and from what you're saying I could never have succeeded.  So it was
	all for nothing.  Yeah, I guess you could say I've paid a price for
	my role, as you call it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Quite so.  Yet the
	beginning of your recovery lies in your questioning.  You have lost
	much but you have also gained.  You have gained knowledge of the
	truth.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">What truth?&rdquo; Torch
	asked warily, watching his face carefully.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You've learned the truth
	that many of the things which you deemed were good and right, have
	no particular virtue in them.  You've learned that many things which
	you thought were evil, are not so.  Before, you chose from
	prejudice.  Now, you can choose from knowledge.  That's a very large
	difference.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But what choices have I got
	left?  It seems to me that I already made a bunch of choices, with
	unhappy consequences.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And it seems to me that the
	most important choice you have yet to make is to choose to forgive
	yourself for making them.  Your friends, your girlfriend, everyone
	you know in the cyberverse, will readily forgive you and accept you.
	 But that will all be meaningless if you cannot make peace with
	yourself.  You must choose the path that <I>you</I> wish to walk,
	not continue to walk down someone else's.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Maybe.  I'm not sure about
	Cylara ever accepting me again.  And I notice you don't include my
	father on your list.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As for your father, you
	have yet to make any choices which would truly disappoint him. 
	That's yet to come.  And you're right, you do face the danger of
	conflict there.  But as for Cylara, did she not tell you exactly
	what you needed to do to win your way back into her heart?  In my
	experience, women can hardly resist doing that.&rdquo;  And he
	grinned at Torch, who couldn't help but smile back, because Cy most
	certainly <I>had</I> told him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I know enough about women
	to know that my real crime in her eyes was having a separate agenda,
	that didn't involve loving her.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Indeed.  When a woman finds
	out that a man she cares about isn't with her because of love, the
	ground tilts under her.  It's a deeply instinctual thing, and also
	quite a logical reaction if you think about it from the standpoint
	of maximizing her chances for successful reproduction.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So she wants me to prove to
	her that I really do love her, that it wasn't just mixing business
	with pleasure while I did my job.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And also, presumably, that
	you understand that love is a matter not of possession, but of
	acceptance.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">That too.  Yeah, she
	essentially told me that.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As did I.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch thought back.  &ldquo;You
	mean the message of the old witch at the Courts of Minos about
	possessing only what is truly yours.  When Sarner and I were
	following you.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes, that.   Technically,
	you were not following me, you were following my Paia, but she was
	using my avatar and acting on my instructions.  She crafted a number
	of implicit messages for you, which only you would be likely to
	interpret correctly.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Now that he had the opportunity to
	ask, Torch had to admit that he was curious.  &ldquo;That last part
	was pretty obvious, but I confess I remain puzzled about the bit
	with the gold bars.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin smiled.  &ldquo;It
	indicated that the wealth you sought was not what it appeared to be.
	 The gold appeared to be desirable wealth, but you could not take it
	with you.  The obvious analogy is that you sought a life in
	meatspace with Cylara as your wife, yet could not take her with you
	out of the cyberverse.  But what's really valuable to you is having
	her in your life, period.  The place is unimportant.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The coronation of Henry IV,
	the Huguenot king who converted to Catholicism, was intended as a
	reminder of the problems stemming from religious intolerance.   And
	that a man who wisely chooses peace and tolerance over obstinate
	doctrinal purity can do much good in the world, as Henry did with
	his Edict of Nantes, which ended a bloody civil war, for a time. 
	Your father is the obvious contemporary exemplar of religious
	rigidity, a hideous thing which can lead even to murder.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The episode with the ladies
	on the Spanish beach was meant to suggest several things.  One, that
	so-called artificial intelligence is no less human, or vulnerable,
	or capable of feeling, than biological intelligence.  Second, that
	Cylara was unquestionably first in your heart.  And finally, that
	you were in a very real sense following in my footsteps, not only
	literally but figuratively.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch raised an eyebrow at Justin.
	 &ldquo;I got most of that.  Later on, if not at the time.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I thought you would.  But
	what are you going to do now?  The Minotaur let you go so that you
	would be free to ponder that question.  I cannot choose for you, but
	it does seem to me that hanging out in the cyberverse without your
	lover makes little sense, when you could be hanging out in any
	number of virtualities with her.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Well maybe I need to
	forgive myself first, like you said.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Justin laughed, not at all
	mockingly.   &ldquo;Perhaps.  Well, maybe this will make doing that
	a little easier.&rdquo;  He handed Torch a small coin-like disc,
	embossed with the Singularity crest, much like the one McGivens had
	given him last year.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And what's this?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Why, the List that you were
	seeking.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch frowned.  &ldquo;I thought
	you said there wasn't one.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The one you were looking
	for didn't exist.  But I had to give the Minotaur something to
	protect, didn't I?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch found himself returning the
	laugh.  &ldquo;In case we actually bagged him, you mean.  So what's
	on it?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Have a look.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch pulled a palmtop reader out
	of his jacket pocket and inserted the disc.  In the display he saw
	nothing but an immense list of names, given in pairs.  Not names of
	servers or virtualities or their coordinates, but of people.  Why,
	there was Justin's name, next to that of someone named Riksana.  And
	further down, his own name, Daniel Cleary, next to Cylara's.  His
	mother and father's names were here.  Salma and Clay.  Even those of
	people who never existed, but were legendary couples nonetheless:
	Romeo and Juliet, Tristan and Isolde, Aragorn and Arwen, Paris and
	Helen of Troy.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It's all couples,&rdquo;
	Torch observed, certain there was another message here.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Names of people throughout
	time, real or imagined, who have loved one another,&rdquo; Justin
	clarified.   &ldquo;In a very real sense, what holds the cyberverse
	together &ndash; verily what holds human civilization together &ndash;
	is not some distant authority, but our ability to love.   Authority
	is in many ways the antithesis of love, because the essence of
	mutual love is choice.  Everyone chooses who and what to love; such
	choices cannot be decreed.  And so if you'd succeeded, this is what
	I wanted you to find.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch shook his head, marveling at
	the irony.  &ldquo;I'm not sure my father would get the point.  And
	I'm pretty should Roger Sarner wouldn't have.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yet you're going to have to
	tell your father something.  You can't change him, Torch.  But you
	can offer him love, and forgiveness, just as I'm sure others will
	offer those things to you.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch could but nod.  He suddenly
	understood, with a self-evidence that made it almost embarrassing,
	that this man sitting next to him was not evil.  &ldquo;Thanks,
	Justin,&rdquo; he said sincerely.  And he offered his hand, which
	Justin shook warmly, like a friend.  Then Justin rose to go.  &ldquo;About
	Cylara...&rdquo; Torch began, forestalling him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">You're thinking you could
	use some analog of a big bouquet of flowers, to make a good
	impression?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch smiled.  &ldquo;Something
	like that.  Any suggestions?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I've just given you some
	news that's not even a week old, and far from common knowledge.  See
	what you can make of that.&rdquo;  And with a final wave, Justin
	turned away, walking back up to the top of the grandstands.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch turned his attention back to
	the regatta, which was now getting ready to start.  It no longer
	seemed to matter to him how his bet turned out.  Any given race like
	this one might be a zero-sum game, but his future didn't have to be.</FONT></DIV>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">They raced their
	horses across the wide valley, galloping side by side along the
	course of a small creek that ran down from the surrounding hills.  
	Sagebrush and dry grasses flew past beneath churning hooves.  As
	their course began to tilt upward, ascending the hillside, Cylara
	slowed her mount to a canter, then to a walk.  The horse blew out a
	loud neigh.  Beside her, Torch turned around to look back the way
	they had come and whooped.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A long upland valley lay before
	them, more than a mile wide, snaking up into a great bay between the
	mountains.  In the middle, the little creek joined a larger river
	which flowed down the length of the valley from the heights,
	glittering in the blazing afternoon sun.  Lingering winter snow pack
	glistered in the top crevices among the purple mountain pinnacles. 
	A large ranch house with attached stables stood far down the valley,
	awaiting their return.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara thought this place looked
	like somewhere in Montana, but she knew it wasn't, merely a virtual
	artist's conception of a western mountain ranch.  She'd suggested it
	because she thought it was important to find common ground with
	Torch, places where they could both live happily.  Fortunately,
	simulations that were based on, or at least inspired by, meatspace
	locations were quite common.  This was a good one, although she knew
	it supported a mere ten miles or so of explorable territory centered
	on the dwelling.  At the moment, it was a private instance.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But in a few hours, Salma and Clay
	would be dropping by for dinner.  It would be the first time they'd
	all been together since she and Torch had made up.  Cylara had
	pulled quite a lot of TRT duty shifts with the Cyberantes in the two
	months they'd been apart.  With those and work she had filled most
	of her time.  But these past few days, with her guy in her life
	again, she'd taken some time off.  Pondering her own motivations,
	she realized that she'd spent so much effort helping the Cyberantes
	because she'd felt a certain need to pay something back, to atone
	because of Torch.  His own membership in the IADC was still under
	suspension, and she wondered idly whether Clay would bring that up
	over dinner tonight.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch beamed at her as they let
	their horses stand blowing.  His flaming hair was mussed where it
	wasn't hidden under his wide-brimmed western hat, and his sparkling
	green eyes twinkled with enjoyment as they looked into her hazel
	ones.  He seemed much more willing to let go and truly appreciate
	each situation and experience they shared.  She guessed this was
	because he'd finally let go of his prejudice that virtual
	experiences were somehow &ldquo;less&rdquo; than 3D ones.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She'd quizzed him about the
	reasons for his sudden change of attitude, and he explained that
	he'd had a conversation with Justin which had done a lot to change
	his mind.  She'd never met Justin, but knew from her contacts with
	Riksana that dealing with the High Sings could be a profound
	experience.  It was Riksana who had helped her to see what she'd
	needed to do to motivate Torch to decide to come back to her.   And
	now it seemed that this relationship was going to recover, instead
	of fading away like her previous ones.  Though there had been times
	when she had despaired of ever hearing from him again.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">One fly in the ointment remained,
	however.  She nudged her horse forward toward a pool in the little
	creek nearby, which still held some clear water.   The horse went
	quite willingly, sniffing eagerly at the water and putting its head
	down to drink as soon as she relaxed the reins.  Torch maneuvered
	his horse to a corresponding position on the opposite bank.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch, I don't mean to
	spoil the moment with an uncomfortable subject, but we've got
	company coming soon, and I think we need to discuss your dad.  What
	do you plan to do about him?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">To her relief, Torch didn't seem
	put out that she had brought up the topic.  He looked at her calmly
	and spoke steadily.  &ldquo;Well, I'm going to go see him, and mum. 
	And I'm going to explain to them that I've rethought my beliefs and
	I can no longer support what they're doing.  I'll tell them you mean
	more to me than their religious beliefs.  I'm going to resign
	formally from the Order.  And once I've done that, I'll apply to the
	IADC for reinstatement.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yeah, I wouldn't blame Clay
	if he insisted on you resigning from the KOJ first.  But how do you
	think your parents will react?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch shrugged, as if unconcerned.
	 &ldquo;Well, mum will probably go to pieces and act like she'd just
	been told I was dead.  Dad will get mad, and probably yell at me
	like I was eight years old.  He'll accuse me of being stupid, and
	traitorous, and maybe a pussy-whipped fool into the bargain.  But
	once he realizes I'm serious and won't back down, he'll probably
	disown me and never speak to me again.   I'm sad about that.  But I
	just can't let the man and his beliefs run my life anymore, Cy.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She agreed silently, but felt a
	twinge of guilt that he would have to endure permanent separation
	from his family for her sake.  &ldquo;Do you think it would help if
	I went with you?&rdquo; she offered.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He laughed heartily.  &ldquo;Once
	they see how drop-dead gorgeous you are, I'll get the sex-brained
	boy routine for sure, big time.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She smiled back.  &ldquo;But would
	it make it any easier for you?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch became more serious.  &ldquo;Of
	course it would.  You're the one that made me see how I wasn't being
	true to myself, and that until I did I couldn't be worthy of the
	love of someone like you.  You can't really love someone properly
	unless you love yourself first.  And all the while I was doing those
	things, spying for the KOJ and all, I despised myself for it.   I
	hated lying to you Cy, and it was sure a poor way to repay you for
	what you offered me.  So now I have to tell the truth to my old man,
	no matter how much it hurts.  But sure, you can come if you want.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She nodded.  &ldquo;That's settled
	then.  When do you want to do it?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Soon,&rdquo; he said
	noncommittally.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It's the first of August
	tomorrow,&rdquo; she supplied unnecessarily.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He shrugged.  &ldquo;Maybe in a
	week or so.  I've got quite a bit of work lined up.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She wasn't about to interfere with
	paying work.  While she had plenty of resources of her own, a
	boyfriend who could pay his own way was infinitely preferable to one
	who might become dependent on her.  Though in fact he'd already made
	her quite a lot of money, or more accurately saved her a lot of
	money.  Because of the news he'd shared with her about the matter
	patterning breakthrough, she'd been able to have Paia exit her long
	positions in those two computing cycle futures contracts at a nice
	profit.   The day before yesterday the news had finally been
	publicly announced at a press conference, and the value of those
	contracts had plummeted, along with the stock prices of a number of
	companies which were dependent on marketing previous technologies. 
	It would likely be a long time before the markets adjusted to all
	the staggering implications of this latest development, so for now
	she was holding onto her gold until the wild swings subsided.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The cyberverse will be
	expanding geometrically now, and it'll cost almost nothing,&rdquo;
	she mused.  &ldquo;I wonder how much we'll even need to work in the
	future.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">We'll all be renting out
	whole worlds for a song, not just seventy-eight square miles of
	nature and a house,&rdquo; he said, referencing the dimensions of
	this simulation.  &ldquo;We'll be rich, baby!&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She smiled.   It was true that
	progress made everyone comparatively richer, and quantum leaps like
	this were bound to pound down the price of almost everything in
	existence.  But regardless of how abundant computing or other
	resources became, the pricing mechanism of the market would always
	remain as an essential guide, to channel demand and tell producers
	and providers exactly how much of everything was needed.  Her
	biggest financial burden that still loomed was maintaining her house
	in meatspace, where everything cost more and real estate prices
	tended to remain stagnant, due to low demand.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'd say race you back to
	the house, but I don't think the horses would appreciate it,&rdquo;
	she joked.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Oh come on, they're just
	simulations,&rdquo; he said, daring her.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Realistic ones, that even
	get thirsty.  I just can't bring myself to wear out a poor horse. 
	Not in this heat.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Torch laughed.  &ldquo;Okay, maybe
	you're right.  Let's canter then.&rdquo;  Clucking to his mount, he
	turned it around and started it trotting forward, down the opposite
	bank of the creek.  She crossed over and gently kicked her mare into
	step alongside.  They picked up speed, the horses shifting gait and
	whinnying as they perceived that they were headed back toward the
	stables.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Despite her words, Cylara had to
	resist the urge to kick her horse back into a gallop.  They reached
	the larger river and turned to follow it downstream.  Her blond hair
	streamed out behind her, floating under her hat with her speed.   It
	was going to be a mess.  After they rubbed down the horses, she'd
	have just enough time to get cleaned up and changed.   The cooking,
	of course, was automated.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">These earthy, visceral real life
	simulations Torch seemed to favor did have a nice feel to them, she
	had to admit.  Despite the fact that you actually had to worry about
	dirt and brushing your hair.  She felt more intensely alive in a
	physical way, more attuned to her senses.  And strenuous riding
	always made her horny as hell, something Torch would discover soon
	after their guests departed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara was intrigued by the hints
	which had been dropped by some of the Full Sings to the effect that
	the war would soon be over.  She hoped it was true.  The future
	whispered of peace, prosperity and happiness.  The bright sun of
	this virtuality seemed to shine on her whole life at this moment. 
	Content to enjoy the ride without hurrying, she maintained a smooth,
	easy canter.  Torch kept pace beside her, as if he couldn't imagine
	being anywhere else.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The signing
	ceremony was only a few minutes away.  For those few remaining
	minutes, Senator Robert Reynolds would continue to be
	acting-President of the North American Federation.  After the
	ceremony was concluded, he would no longer be the chief executive,
	or even a senator, because the North American Federation would no
	longer exist.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Articles of Dissolution which
	he was about to sign were not his idea of a good piece of
	legislation.  But the simple fact was that it didn't really dissolve
	the Federation so much as give mere formal recognition to a state of
	affairs which already existed.  In legal parlance it rendered <I>de
	jure</I> what was <I>de facto</I> reality already.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds found himself thinking,
	as he usually did at such times, about historical events which
	paralleled the present.  In this case, he pictured himself standing
	approximately where the last Premier of the Soviet Union, Mikhail
	Gorbachev, had stood in late December of 1991.  Gorbachev had wanted
	openness and reforms, but had finally been forced reluctantly to
	recognize that the Soviet Union was done, particularly in economic
	terms.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The Federation was likewise
	finished, there was no doubt of that.  Its monetary functions were
	inoperative due to the total worthlessness of its currency.  Its
	regulatory functions were impaired in the cyberverse by a complete
	lack of enforceability, and in meatspace by a complete lack of
	enforcers, due to its inability to pay them.   The Federation's
	responsibilities for the provision of infrastructure were long ago
	usurped or made irrelevant by technological change.   Its border
	enforcement functions had been a joke without a punchline for years.
	  Its record-keeping functions were performed more accurately and
	efficiently by private AIs.  Even its charitable safety net
	functions had been assumed without difficulty by private parties in
	the wake of its currency collapse.  And with the new cornucopia of
	benefits now in the pipeline from the matter patterning
	breakthrough, there would be even less reason to worry about unmet
	basic needs in the future.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Worst of all, the government's law
	enforcement functions were not only impaired, they had actually
	begotten and helped perpetrate the worst wave of crime and violence
	ever to ravage contemporary society.  More murders,  thefts,
	beatings, rapes, destruction of property, and acts of vandalism had
	been committed under color of law by the late Roger Sarner's
	Homeland Security cohorts &ndash; abetted by the KOJ radicals &ndash;
	in a span of a mere three months, than had been committed by all the
	world's private criminals taken together over the past ten years.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Lastly, the Federation's military
	arm had not only been pressed into service on behalf of Homeland
	Security's sociopathic objectives, but had very nearly been utilized
	to commit indiscriminate mass democide.   But for the timely
	intervention of Justin and the IADC, the Federation would have been
	devastated by its own aged nuclear arsenal.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This final circumstance had
	virtually dictated the date of today's bill signing: August 6<SUP>th</SUP>,
	2045.  Today was the one hundredth anniversary of the bombing of
	Hiroshima.  The citizens of the Federation had decided, in no
	uncertain terms, that a government which could plot to do such a
	thing, especially to its own people, was simply too dangerous to go
	on existing.  That Cyberantes woman he'd met, Salma Rivera, had been
	right.  Reynolds had found little enough support for rebuilding the
	Federation among his own fellow officials, and virtually none
	amongst the people.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So, like Gorbachev before him, he
	bowed to the inevitable.   What was still unclear was what, if
	anything, would eventually replace the Federation.   Some pundits
	predicted the development of a patchwork of local governing bodies
	to enforce property rights and certain basic legal prohibitions in
	meatspace, something like glorified homeowners associations.  Others
	anticipated that the Cyberantes model would remain in vogue, where
	competing private security services would provide protection,
	investigate crimes involving aggression against persons or property,
	and administer a system of punishments and restitution.  Still
	others openly predicted total meatspace anarchy &ndash; and
	frequently asserted that that was okay with them.  But one thing was
	certain: there was simply no support at present for the creation of
	a substitute overarching government with plenary powers.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Oddly, he could detect no
	inclination on the part of those who had effectively been left in
	power as the Federation disintegrated to exploit their position. 
	Thorsten and other major figures within the IADC, Justin and other
	leading Full Sings, none of them seemed to want authority for
	themselves.  When he'd gone so far as to point this out to Justin,
	he'd simply shaken his head and declared: &ldquo;No one has the
	wisdom to rule over others.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Robert Reynolds would not be quick
	to contradict that self-effacing judgment.  He had seen too much in
	his lengthy career in public service.  He knew his own faults and
	weaknesses.  The laws of unintended consequences had finally caught
	up with him, despite his lifelong idealistic race to stay ahead of
	them.  Yet he still couldn't extinguish his fear of the idea of
	nobody ruling at all.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He looked sadly at his wife, and
	wordlessly put his arm around her shoulders.  Marguerite smiled and
	leaned close to kiss the side of his face.  He couldn't imagine
	doing this without her.  A lifetime of service, come to this. 
	Failure.  Defeat.  Rejection.  The antique pen in his pocket was
	not, of course, inked with his own blood, but it might as well be.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It was time.  He dropped his arm
	off his wife's shoulder and started forward.  She followed.  Today's
	bill signing was taking place in the Federation's capital city of
	Chicago, which had been chosen as such due to its geographic
	position more or less central to the continent's population, as well
	as the unwillingness of any of the three constituent nations to see
	one of the others' former capitals become the new center of
	government.   The enormous park on the shores of Lake Michigan was
	packed as it had not been in a long time, as was the surrounding
	city.  Few events in meatspace drew these kinds of numbers anymore. 
	Perhaps a million people were on hand to witness this historic
	moment.  Millions if not billions more would doubtless attend
	reenactments of it in cyberverse simulations over the years to come.
	 Reynolds had never had such an audience in his entire career.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As his tall, silver-gilt frame
	emerged from the pavilion and began crossing the field to the raised
	stage, a cheer went up.   His path was lined with media types, and
	government dignitaries, most of whom he knew, clinging to the last
	moments of their dignity.  In no particular hurry, he paused to
	shake hands and exchange pleasantries with anyone he knew.  He had
	donned his politician face, which made everything into a series of
	calm smiles and firm handshakes, polite words and light humor.  He
	was aware as seldom before that he was an actor, playing a role to
	its finish.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">At last there was no one left to
	greet, and so he squeezed Marguerite's hand for luck and courage,
	and stepped up alone onto the platform.  It contained a table draped
	in Federation colors, with the Articles and a microphone resting on
	it, and a simple wooden chair for him to sit in.  And of course,
	another microphone atop a tall stand at the front corner of the
	stage.  He headed for that one at once, and stood behind it quietly,
	waiting for silence.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He looked around him at the crowd,
	wishing to engrave the scene in his memory.  To his right was the
	lake, covered with boats as far as he could see.   Before him, the
	sun was setting over the still-impressive Chicago skyline.  To his
	left the crowd stretched, out of the park, up the downtown streets,
	hanging out of windows, clustered on rooftops.  It was warm, and a
	bit muggy, but no longer blazing hot as it had been earlier today. 
	The scents of hotdogs and beer, and the laughter of children
	splashing in the slowly curling waves, took him back to his youth. 
	Once upon a time, such scenes had been the norm, on any important
	occasion in such a large city.  Today, it felt like one last hurrah,
	a final gathering after which only nostalgia would remain.  <I>Change
	is the way of all things,</I> he reminded himself.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">At length the exuberance of the
	crowd died down, and Reynolds judged he could begin.  He'd attempted
	to prepare an oration for this occasion, but had given up on it as a
	bad job long before he was satisfied with it.  He understood in his
	heart that these people were here not to listen to him, but merely
	to witness the spectacle of the victory of a people who had
	successfully withdrawn consent from their government, and &ndash; so
	far at least &ndash; declined to give their consent to another. 
	Like a defeated general signing an instrument of surrender, he had
	no choice, really.  But he was not about to remind them of why they
	didn't like politicians, or exhibit any sour grapes, or say anything
	just to save face.  Any speech he gave would inevitably get
	sound-bited down to only a few key sentences anyway.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So that was all he was going to
	give them.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">My fellow North Americans,&rdquo;
	he began solemnly, and then paused while a hush fell.  &ldquo;Democracy
	has been the practice and the watchword of enlightened governments
	for centuries.  Today we are gathered here not to part ways with
	democracy, but to acknowledge its supremacy.  The people of this
	continent have spoken, with an overwhelming voice that we, your
	public servants, cannot fail to hear, or to obey.  The times we live
	in have changed, and will change even more in the years to come.  As
	the American Declaration of Independence stated long ago, it is the
	right of the people to alter or abolish their government.  And so it
	is that the North American Federation today reaches its end.  The
	task of designing new safeguards for their future safety and
	happiness now returns to the people.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">It has been my honor to
	represent my district in the Senate since the inception of the
	Federation.  And my even greater honor to serve as its
	acting-President over this past month, following the tragic deaths
	of the President, the Vice President, and the Chairman of the House.
	 This trust was placed in me with the understanding that I would lay
	down my position as soon as the people elected a legal successor.  
	It is now plain that the people have selected no one but themselves.
	 Therefore, it becomes my duty and my privilege to perform the
	following act.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Without further ado, Reynolds slid
	smoothly into the seat behind the table, pulled out his old ink pen,
	uncapped it, and laid it beside the document.  Cheering began, and
	the chanting of slogans, but they slowly died away as he picked up
	the parchment and thumbed on the desk microphone before him to
	continue.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">From the earliest days of
	jurisprudence on this continent, it was established that governments
	manifest their existence as legal corporations with special powers. 
	Therefore, in recognition of the demands of an overwhelming majority
	of the shareholders, and in accordance with the unanimous resolution
	of the members of Congress acting as trustees and directors, I,
	Robert C. Reynolds, acting chief executive officer of the
	corporation doing business as The North American Federation, do
	hereby affix my signature and seal to the Articles of Dissolution
	dissolving the said government corporation.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And with that, he picked up his
	pen, took a deep breath, and signed his name with a flourish.  Even
	before he rose to his feet, the cheering and celebrating began.  He
	remained briefly on stage, smiling and waving with both hands to the
	multitude.  He saw thousands of signs being waved bearing various
	slogans and emblems, everything from &ldquo;Don't Tread on Me&rdquo;
	to &ldquo;1945-2045: Never Again!&rdquo;  A chant of <I>never again,
	never again, never again! </I>rose through the crowd and then died
	back down, but most of the celebrants were simply jubilant.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reynolds, senator no longer,
	retreated from the platform, hugged his wife, took her hand, and
	slowly began making his way out of the crowd.   It wouldn't be all
	bad, being a private citizen once again, he reflected.  He glimpsed
	Justin standing along the way with some of his associates,
	applauding him.  <I>Well done, Robert,</I> he mouthed silently. 
	Reynolds smiled back.  He supposed Justin had foreseen this all
	along, when he'd rescued him so that he could make the important
	choices he'd said were ahead of him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">More importantly, he'd also given
	him back the love of his life.  Marguerite was a miracle, of God, of
	science, and of herself.  A life with her in it could not frighten
	him, no matter what else he had to give up.  Would he someday go the
	distance and become as she was?  He couldn't tell, though he did
	know that the more time he spent there, the more he understood that
	the future of the human race was in the cyberverse, not here in
	meatspace.  One single world, no matter how treasured or how it
	might be perfected, could not fulfill all the needs of humanity.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">How do you feel, Robert?&rdquo;
	she asked him gently now.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He stopped and looked at her.  He
	took a deep, refreshing breath, held it, let it out.  &ldquo;I feel
	that from now on, there will always be more beginnings, than
	endings.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She smiled her understanding and
	agreement.  The former first couple made their way across the park,
	greeting well-wishers and laughing with old acquaintances.   Today,
	this part of the world had finally been set free.  And so had they.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara and Daniel
	dismissed their robotic air taxi in the front yard of the Cleary
	estate.  It took off with a muted rush of air and a whine of
	engines, and arced over the pine trees, humming away westward,
	presumably to its next customer.  Daniel looked around the yard
	briefly.  He had not been here in more than a month.  The drying
	weeds of summer were going to seed under the fences.  The lawn
	around the house was mowed and the hedge along the garage was
	recently clipped, suggesting that the maintenance staff was still on
	the job.  (The senior Clearys would never employ robotic gardeners.)</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The house was large and rambling,
	with a two-story front facing the circular drive, and a wing running
	back from each end, forming a 'U' shape with an inner garden nestled
	between the wings.  The house still had wooden siding, which could
	really use another coat of white paint, if not before winter then
	certainly by next spring.  Drapes were drawn over those windows they
	could see, which mostly faced west, to keep out the hot Idaho
	afternoon sun.  Everything looked closed up in fact, but Daniel was
	pretty sure one or the other of his parents must be home.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There was an immense dog run, over
	by the barn opposite the house, and one of their Newfoundlands stood
	at the gate, wagging its tail and emitting a friendly bark in
	greeting.  Torch waved at the dog, which he thought he recognized,
	and which appeared to recognize him.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This is where you lived?&rdquo;
	Cylara asked, looking around her with interest.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Grew up,&rdquo; Daniel
	corrected.  &ldquo;Haven't actually lived here since I was nineteen.
	 Mum still keeps a room for me, though.&rdquo;  He thought: <I>Now
	who's interested in meatspace living arrangements?</I>  But he said
	nothing, not wishing to revive an old argument.  Being here again
	did not make him happy.  He was here because he needed to be,
	because he had something to do.  He'd rather be back at the virtual
	ranch resort, or indeed, almost anywhere with Cylara.  And they had
	anywhere and everywhere available to them to share.  He could
	scarcely understand how he had ever wanted to have her in a place
	like this, and <I>only</I> in a place like this.  She looked around
	curiously, but said no more, obviously respecting his mood.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There was nothing for it but to
	get it over with.  Daniel walked up to the big brown door of his
	family home resolutely, and punched the doorbell twice.  After a
	minute or two of waiting, he exchanged a glance with Cy and dinged
	it again.  Still no answer.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm sure they must be
	home,&rdquo; Daniel muttered.  &ldquo;Sometimes dad can't hear the
	doorbell in his study.  It's near the back of the north wing.  Maybe
	they had to let the servants go.&rdquo;  He supposed that the
	Federation's collapse, formalized by ex-President Reynolds three
	days ago, had probably hit his family pretty hard financially.   He
	pulled out his house key and fitted it in the lock.  Ringing the
	bell was primarily a courtesy, made since he had not come alone.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The house was cooler than the
	summer day outside.  The hardwood floors were brightly polished, the
	walls an off-white only slightly darker than those outside.  Real
	wooden furniture greeted their eyes in the form of an upholstered
	settee, an inlaid coffee table, and some coat and hat racks in the
	foyer.  There was also an old-fashioned guest book lying on the
	table, bearing many signatures, marked open with an ancient fountain
	pen.  More wooden end tables graced the halls in both directions,
	supporting ceramic lamps with fine embroidered shades.  The terminus
	of a curving stair stood nearby, leading upstairs, with a carved and
	polished banister.   A reproduction of da Vinci's <I>The Last Supper</I>
	hung over the settee, and below that an embroidered piece of old
	linen in a glass frame reading &ldquo;Bless This House.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara sucked in her breath. 
	&ldquo;Everything here looks genuinely pre-nanotech.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel nodded.  &ldquo;Yep.  My
	parents won't have anything molecularly manufactured in the house. 
	A cook helps my mother prepare all the meals by hand.  And I'd
	better warn you, my dad wears glasses.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She laughed musically.  &ldquo;I'd
	heard that, but wasn't sure whether it was just a rumor.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Nope, that's dad in a
	nutshell.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">She shook her head, marveling.  &ldquo;I
	haven't seen a house like this since I was in my teens.&rdquo; 
	Acting on a sudden impulse, she stepped forward and quickly
	scribbled her name in the guest book.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I've <I>never</I> seen
	another house quite like this one,&rdquo; Daniel agreed glumly.  He
	rolled his eyes at her antic with the guest book.  &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He led her to the left, through a
	long dining room with double doors behind it that must lead to the
	kitchen.  A kind of family room followed that.  Then there was
	another stair at the corner, which Daniel climbed.  This one was
	carpeted.  They emerged at the end of an upstairs hall running at
	right angles, and Daniel started down it without a word.  They
	passed several closed doors on both sides, which might be guest
	bedrooms or something.  Due to all the closed doors which blocked
	the natural light, the hallway was a little dim.  There were however
	a couple of skylights along the way.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Near the end of the passage,
	Daniel paused in a doorway to the left which was open, and rapped
	his knuckles on the door frame.  Cylara moved to stand next to him,
	looking in.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A man was sitting alone in what
	was obviously a study.  There was a large oak desk, stained a dark
	reddish brown.  Shelves of books lined two walls.  Paintings and
	framed photographs of family, friends, or religious subjects covered
	much of the space on the others.  The window was closed, but its
	lace curtains were open to let in the north light.  Despite this,
	there was a reading lamp activated on the desk.  Its pool of light
	fell on a pile of pages with actual handwriting on them.  The man in
	the plush, leather high-backed swivel-chair behind the desk was
	looking up at them with a neutral expression, and sure enough, he
	wore glasses, that seemed to make his blue eyes look a touch larger.
	 Cylara could see the family resemblance, though this man's auburn
	hair was graying and worn shorter than Daniel's, which was brown. 
	He had the same handsome, pleasantly masculine strong lines in his
	face.  His expression through his glasses was not particularly
	welcoming, his lips pursed into a thin line.  Oddly, he wore a
	colorful tie.  <I>Who wears a tie alone in his own house?</I> Cylara
	wondered.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So, Daniel, you've come
	back.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel jerked his thumb over his
	shoulder.  &ldquo;No one answered the door,&rdquo; he said, keeping
	his tone casual.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes.  Well, we don't have
	full time staff here any longer.  We can no longer afford it, as I'm
	sure you can well imagine.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Right.  The Federation
	breakup and all that.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary senior flicked his son a
	glance that this time clearly carried disapproval.  &ldquo;The
	Federation broke up because Roger Sarner died, and he was the only
	man who could hold it together.  Sarner died because you abandoned
	him.  I have my sources and I know the story.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Sarner died because he did
	something stupid, father,&rdquo; Daniel said contradicting him,
	which Cylara sensed was not something he'd done very often.  &ldquo;He
	did a lot of things that were stupid.  I should know, I had to put
	up with them for weeks.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And yet, despite being so
	much smarter and wiser than the late Homeland Security Secretary,
	you return to me empty-handed.  But not alone.  Who is this woman
	with you?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara was not about to let Daniel
	introduce her to anyone who spoke in such a peremptory tone, and was
	rude enough to ask who she was in the third person.  &ldquo;I'm
	Cylara Janovic, Mr. Cleary,&rdquo; she said pleasantly before Daniel
	could open his mouth.  &ldquo;I'm Daniel's &ndash; what did they
	used to say? &ndash; significant other.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara, this is my father,
	Maxwell Cleary,&rdquo; Daniel said politely, completing the
	introduction with a gesture.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The degree of your
	significance is certainly interesting, Miss Janovic,&rdquo; the
	Reverend replied, speaking to her directly for the first time.  &ldquo;Are
	you the reason why my son has abandoned his holy mission?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">But I didn't abandon it,
	father,&rdquo; Daniel said quickly.  &ldquo;I've come to give you
	the List, as promised.&rdquo;  He held up a flat plastic micro-disc,
	with its distinctive rainbow gleam.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">His father raised an eyebrow at
	him.  &ldquo;Really.  Well, it may come too late, but I suppose we'd
	better take a look at it, then.&rdquo;  He opened a desk drawer and,
	somewhat to Cylara's surprise, pulled out a book screen reader.  As
	Daniel approached and handed him the disc, he flashed Cylara a
	glance and spoke to her again.  &ldquo;Almost the only piece of
	computing machinery I permit myself, Miss Janovic.  It is
	occasionally necessary for me to read screed originating from the
	other side.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara marveled silently at the
	degree of distortion in this man.  Just his few interactions with
	Daniel so far, and with her, his sheer domineering, snide assurance,
	gave her a fresh new sympathy for her lover, forced to grow up with
	this.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reverend Cleary activated the
	reader and inserted the disc.  He read in silence for a time,
	scrolling down a few pages.  Then he looked up, nonplussed.  &ldquo;Is
	this in some sort of code?  There are no names of virtualities here,
	or GPS coordinates, only the names of people.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Special people, father,&rdquo;
	Daniel clarified.  &ldquo;People in past, present, or legend who
	loved one another.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And what then is the
	significance?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">How about that true love is
	a value which is universally shared?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Maxwell shook his head.   &ldquo;Don't
	start with your free love nonsense.  I know what universal love
	means in the cyberverse.  It means that you can love anything that
	moves.  I see that the author of your celebrated lover's list here,
	has included what I can only assume are gay couples.  For example,&rdquo;
	he said pointing down at the screen, &ldquo;here we have Frederic
	Chopin and George Sand.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">There are indeed same-sex
	couples on that list, but George Sand was a woman, father,&rdquo;
	Daniel said with a smile.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">A writer,&rdquo; Cylara
	added.  &ldquo;That was the masculine pen name she had to use to get
	published.  I admire women like that, and I hope that someday I
	might get to meet her.&rdquo;  Daniel shot her a cautioning look.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The elder Cleary's face clouded
	for an instant, but he did not argue the point further.  Instead he
	set down the reader and looked up at his son.  <I>Now he will attack
	on another tangent, </I>Cylara predicted silently.  She was not
	disappointed.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">This so-called List is
	merely worthless data.  What has become of the real Master Node
	List?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Father, it never existed. 
	It was a ruse.  The Sings told us what we wanted to hear, so that
	we'd chase our tails in the cyberverse instead of doing something
	more effective in meatspace.  And it worked.  By the time I finally
	managed to get hold of that List &ndash; and I assure you, that one
	there is the only one there is &ndash; it was too late.  The matter
	patterning breakthrough had been achieved.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">So you believe this
	nonsense about computers without computers, in rocks and trees?&rdquo;
	Cleary challenged.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Yes, because it's not
	nonsense,&rdquo; Daniel answered steadily.  &ldquo;It's true.  It's
	real.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Your war is over, Mr.
	Cleary, can't you see that?&rdquo; Cylara put in.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He gave her an openly hostile
	glance through his spectacles.  &ldquo;Oh no, miss.  The Devil is
	always quick to proclaim victory, in order to tempt the faithful to
	give up the struggle.  But there is still a victory to be won.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">How, father?&rdquo; Daniel
	asked, pleading calmly.  &ldquo;The government is gone.  Other
	governments around the world are said to be teetering as well.  If
	we torch a single computer anywhere, the Cyberantes will be all over
	us.  We can no more fight them than jump over the moon.  And pretty
	soon it will make no difference even if we could somehow destroy
	every piece of identifiable computing hardware in the world. 
	There's no way left that the Order can win this struggle, father.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Reverend Cleary smiled a cruel
	smile, more chilling than any display of rage.  &ldquo;You don't
	think that God can win it, Daniel?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">His son looked exasperated.  How
	had he ever been so influenced by this man?  &ldquo;I think that for
	sure, divine intervention is the only thing that could,&rdquo; he
	agreed amiably.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And so our duty should be
	what?&rdquo; Cleary asked mildly, like one encouraging a dull
	student. Both Daniel and Cylara looked at him quizzically.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I don't know dad, though
	I'm certain you'll tell us.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Why, to pray for exactly
	that of course.  For divine intervention,&rdquo; he explained
	calmly.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">To pray for the end of the
	world?&rdquo; Cylara asked, with plain disbelief.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Precisely.&rdquo;  Reverend
	Cleary steepled his fingers on his desk before him, radiating
	conviction.  &ldquo;Do you know what this is?&rdquo; he went on,
	glancing at the document he'd been working on writing when they
	arrived.  &ldquo;Of course not, so I'll tell you.  It's my Epistle
	to the Faithful.  A letter, to all the Christian Moshes left in the
	world.  Like the apostle Paul, we have fought the good fight, we
	have finished the course.  And there is for us a crown.  When enough
	of us join in prayer, this fallen world <I>will</I> be destroyed. 
	And the Faithful <I>will</I> be redeemed, and lifted off it into
	heaven.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif"><I>Madness is all he has left</I>,
	Cylara thought sadly.  Aloud she said: &ldquo;I don't want the end
	of the world, Reverend Cleary.  I like this one just fine, and I
	wouldn't miss its future for anything.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary nodded to her, eyes
	twinkling.  &ldquo;I see.  And does your young woman speak for you
	as well, my son?&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Daniel swallowed hard, then said
	the words he'd really come to say.  &ldquo;I'd have to agree that
	she does, sir.  I tried hard to achieve what we set out to do.  But
	we lost, and it's out of our hands now.  And to be honest, I don't
	think the Rapture is going to come down no matter how many people
	pray for it.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Maxwell Cleary sighed wearily,
	then deactivated the reader screen, slid open his desk drawer and
	replaced the reader inside it.  &ldquo;I'd hoped for better from my
	own son, I must admit,&rdquo; he said as he did so.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I'm sorry if I disappoint
	you, father.  But I think it's time I made my own life choices now.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Indeed, you should,&rdquo;
	came the serene reply, and then there was a small sound, like a
	cross between a chirp and a thump.  Daniel sagged sideways against
	Cylara, with a gasp of indrawn breath.  She supported him as he
	crumpled to the floor, an expression of surprise on his face. 
	Scanning him anxiously, she noticed a tiny, feathered dart sticking
	out of his shirt front.  Rising, anger welling up in her mind, she
	looked at Daniel's father and spied the small black dart gun in his
	hand, held just above the desk blotter.  He must have drawn it from
	inside the drawer even as he finished replacing the reader.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cylara's mind went hot with fury,
	and her body tensed and coiled.  Father or not, the Reverend was
	about to get a brief taste of her Cyberantes hand-to-hand training. 
	Then her vision swam as a second chirp-thump was heard.  She managed
	to brush the dart out of her shoulder before she staggered and fell
	into a heap beside her lover.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">I know all about your fancy
	nanite implants,&rdquo; Cleary said with icy calm.  He was too calm,
	too cool, he was so crazy, she should have seen it immediately. 
	&ldquo;I'm sure you could take me apart in about two seconds flat,
	couldn't you my dear?&rdquo; he asked rhetorically as he stashed the
	dart gun back in his desk and slid the drawer closed again.  She
	found she could not speak.  Beside her on the floor, Daniel gurgled
	something unintelligible.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Cleary came around the desk to
	stand looking down at them, but again, spoke only to Cylara.  &ldquo;But
	not once your excellent enhanced circulatory system has been flooded
	with a potent neuro-toxin.  You've taken my son from me.  I'd like
	nothing better than to cut your pretty throat and watch you bleed to
	death slowly &ndash; but I've no illusions about that being fatal,
	either.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He stepped around them and walked
	out into the hall.  She heard him open a door opposite.  Then came
	sounds like a case being unlocked, a hinged door swinging, and
	something rattling.  There were more sounds like drawers being slid
	open, and some metallic clicks.  Cylara struggled valiantly to raise
	her head but could not.  It was like being paralyzed.  At last, with
	a convulsive spasm of effort, she managed to twitch her legs just
	enough to roll her body flat onto her back.  She had knocked out the
	dart, and knew that her medical nanobots would already be hard at
	work neutralizing the poison, removing its toxic molecules from her
	system.  She felt weak and queasy, but her vision just might be
	clearing a tiny bit.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Abruptly Maxwell Cleary's
	suit-clad legs marched back into her field of wavering vision.  And
	something else was dangling by his knees, something like twin grey
	tubes.  What was it?  As she strove to focus, a recoiling shock
	twisted through her belly as her brain identified the object as a
	shotgun barrel.  Desperately, she tried to flex her fingers, but
	they only trembled slightly.  Daniel's dart was still in his chest. 
	This was going to be up to her.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">My, you seem to be
	recovering quickly,&rdquo; his voice said with mock admiration. 
	&ldquo;Oh, I see.  Removed the dart, didn't you?&rdquo;  She gagged
	out something that she hoped would sound like an attempt at speech. 
	Her only chance was for him to wax philosophical, attempt to justify
	himself, preach to her, give her absolution, anything that would
	waste enough time to let her recover a bit more.  Perhaps only for a
	minute or two.  She felt like she could almost move, but didn't want
	to let him see her try it until she was ready.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Oh, I'd love to continue
	our discussion, my dear.  I'd love to find out whether you can
	manage to remain a godless atheist with death staring you right in
	the face.   I'd love to spend time telling you exactly what I think
	of bleached-blond, capped-teethed, painted, siliconed, open-thighed
	sluts like you and what they do to good men's reason.  But with that
	dart out, I don't think that would be wise.  So it seems all I have
	left to say to you is: may God have mercy on your soul.  If you do
	manage to repent in your last moments, He'll know, and perhaps He
	will.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">And with that he brought the
	shotgun up to her face, almost close enough to make her go
	cross-eyed.  Ready or not, it had to be now.   With a growl and a
	grimace, she managed to reach up to bat the weapon's aim aside.  
	Cleary stepped back hastily with a gasp of surprise.  Desperately,
	Cylara rolled over and scrabbled forward, grasping drunkenly for the
	gun barrel.  Reverend Cleary took another sharp step back into the
	doorway, brought the weapon up toward her face again, just out of
	reach, and pulled both triggers.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif"><I>Blazing white light&ndash;</I></FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">The sudden roar boomed in Daniel's
	ears, overriding the pounding of his heart between the walls of his
	skull, which was all it seemed he could hear clearly.  There had
	been some mumbled, indistinct words, then this.   At the same moment
	something slapped across his cheek and ear, something wet.  His
	vision was narrowed down to a small circle, and now he seemed to see
	his father peering at him as if down a short tube.  He was not
	looking at Daniel, but gazing down as if at something in his hands
	that he was fiddling with.  Dimly, Daniel heard a sharp snick and
	then his father looked up and into his face.</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">Your whore, Cylara, has
	gone ahead of you, my son,&rdquo; he said, while Daniel struggled
	groggily to make sense of the bizarre words.  &ldquo;Though I
	strongly suspect she may be going the other way,&rdquo; he added
	with a chuckle.  Daniel suddenly realized that his father was
	holding a gun.  Only after a slow moment did he come to associate
	that with the noise he'd just heard.   No...</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">As I feared all along, the
	cyberverse took you from me, Daniel,&rdquo; his father continued in
	that maddeningly soft, calm voice.   &ldquo;Because you were my son,
	I hoped you might be strong enough to resist the pull of the Devil's
	playground.  And maybe you would have, had it not been for that
	woman there.  Women are a temptation at the best of times.  Speaking
	of women, your mother isn't here, she's visiting your aunt.  I
	suppose that's just as well,&rdquo; he concluded with a weary sigh
	and a silent pause.  &ldquo;She might not understand.&rdquo;</FONT><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">He leveled the shotgun at Daniel
	so that
